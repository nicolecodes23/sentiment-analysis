Kyle Ellis,5.0,"I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.

First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant.

I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be ""The One With the Scene in the Diner"". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clich√©d and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile.

The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking.

I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection.

Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect.

There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Apolline Dubois-Nguyen,5.0,"Friends is one of the greatest and best sitcoms of all time. Friends is about the lives of six unique adults who overcome different adventures and experiences which makes their lives both troublesome and entertaining. Jennifer Aniston portrays Rachel Green, Courteney Cox portrays Monica Geller, Lisa Kudrow portrays Phoebe Buffay, David Schwimmer portrays Ross Geller, Matt Leblanc portrays Joey Tribbiani, and Mathew Perry portrays Chandler Bing. This show coincidentally takes place in Manhattan, New York. 

The main premise of this show depicts the bond and lives of all six outgoing characters as they indulge in difficult situations and find their own pathways in life. In the beginning, Rachel Green ran off on Barry's wedding and chose to live with her friend, Monica where she formed a closer bond with the other characters. At the time, the six characters were quite clueless in their lives and constantly relied on each other for relationships and career issues.  

The writing is absolutely incredible. Producers Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright had an amazing writing crew which brought all the jokes and conversations to life. The producers and writers wrote a plot line which made the audience and fans more hooked in the show. The characters were beautifully portrayed. The entire cast did a phenomenal job. No one could have been better than the actors picked for this show. Besides that, the sets were memorable and the costumes were superb. Throughout the show, it almost felt that you were there with the characters.  The music that was played in the show also matched the scenes accordingly. The show rightfully deserved the numerous amounts of emmies they received. 

Therefore, I strongly recommend this show to anyone and everyone who wants see friendships, trust, love, relationships combined in one show or just and outstanding sitcom. I adored this show and it completely exceeded by expectations. The best part of this show is the when the characters each started their own family: it is a heartfelt reinforcement when we see all characters having their dream careers ahead of them as well as their friends who will always be there for each other. I was on the verge of tears in a couple of episodes of the show. Similarly, the majority of my friends, who enjoy watching shows like I do, especially loved Friends because of its astounding writing, acting, and amazing bonds.  

There is not much that I can say to improve this show. Although the show mostly revolves around relationships, it isn't just about love. It's really about the friendship and the bond that the main characters have with each other, inspiring us all. 

In conclusion, it's not just any show. It is a very compelling, hilarious, touching and exceptional sitcom. This show brings various vital life lessons and a meaningful lesson about friendship. The ending is flawless. All six characters are happy and have moved on with their lives. The acting, casting, costumes, sets and music were all exceptional."

Peter Elamery,5.0,"Wow! I'm glad I had the chance to watch this one! Instead of buying Hulu, Prime, Disney Plus, and Paramount+ individually, I watched this on MovieMeld. net, which brings together content from the top streaming services into a single platform. For what reason? It's inexpensive, the streaming quality is excellent, and I'm fed up with other platforms limiting account sharing! I highly recommend testing it out! Now, with my rant over, allow me to offer my critique ... lmfao

My favorite show of all time. Friends is easily the best show to have ever been made, the show is relatable to anyone of any age, has amazing characters that you are bound to connect with, great writing, amazing acting, and so comforting as well. No show has made me laugh more, put a smile on my face more, cry as intensely, and had me as emotionally invested as Friends. You connect to every single character, and you get to see these amazing people grow and learn and change as they navigate the world over 10 years. Friends has taught me so much about being a good friend, partner, sibling, and just a good human in general. If you ever feel down, watching Friends will surely brighten your mood. I loved all the characters, Joey's wholesome, sweetness, and innocence, Phoebe's uniqueness, quirkiness, and joyfulness despite a troubled upbringing, seeing Rachel grow from being a spoiled girl marrying for money to a strong and independent woman working in fashion, Monica's wonderful scrappiness, cleanliness, and responsibility to take care of others, Chandler's signature sarcasm, pure funniness, and caringness, and Ross's passion and love. I will always love this show. It got me through a tough time in high school, made me feel whole, helped me distract me from my pain, and always made me happy. This show will always hold a special place in my heart and I will never forget Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey. Ever. I love this show so much and if you haven't watched it already this is your sign. You won't regret it."
Jules Sherwood,5.0,"Grew up watching FRIENDS when it first aired in the 90s and the show created lightning in a bottle with each actor they cast for their iconic roles. Of course everyone knows who Jennifer Aniston is now but back then she was not massively known and this like her costars was her breakthrough role and anywhere they went in the world people in the street would shout their characters name.

Lisa Kudrow was known to some as Ursula on Mad About You and thanks to the bosses there allowed to her be on both shows playing twin sisters in a double episode of the 1st season where in we get guest appearances not only from Helen Hunt but George Clooney and  the actor who was Dr Carter whilst they were filming ER.

We all loved the Ross/Rachel drama along with Monica finding love with Chandler. Phoebe getting her man and Joey being Joey.  

The show attracted alot of famous faces including Julia Roberts, Danny Devito, Tate Donovan, Bruce Willis, Dan Castellena aka Homer, Hank Azaria, Paul Rudd, Reese Witherspoon, Christina Applegate, Tom Selleck, Brad Pitt, Freddie Prinze Jr and many more. Also for those of you who never watched the show we got appearances from Tom Conti, Jennifer Saunders, June Whitfield, Helen Baxendale, Richard Branson and The Duchess of York when they came over to England to film the Wedding of Ross and Emily where Ross says the wrong name shows how popular it was all around the world in the early days, this was before twitter.

Charlie Sheen makes a guest star appearance before his long run in comedy Two and a Half Men. Jennifer Grey shows up as ex friend of Rachels Mindy who marries Barry the man she left at the altar in the 1st episode.  For those stargate fans we get Peter Deluise showing his acting skills before he was more known as a director for Stargate SG1.

Of course we can't leave out the one and only Janice played by Maggie Wheeler who was a staple for Chandlers hysterics anytime she came in and uttered that immortal line ""Oh My God"" before that freaky laugh she did, what an asset she was to the show alongside Elliot Gould and Christine Pickles who played the parents of Ross and Monica Geller.

This show proves with great writing and acting how something so beloved has lasted for 25 years, we all have our favourite episodes and for each generation that has come since have found things that are relatable, not many shows or sitcoms have that power.

So grateful I have complete seasons 1 to 10 on DVD as I can sit down and enjoy Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe and watch their antics as they try to handle daily life.   

If you just want a good old fashioned belly laugh then FRIENDS is must watch tv.  America was at it's height in good comedy shows, Frasier, Everybody Loves Raymond, Seinfield, Mad About You and many more, to bad that there is no creativity anymore."

Nydia Jones,0.0,"Someone said''THE WORST SITCOM EVERRRR! i knew there was some series named friends but never got a chance to watch and this october i downloaded it to watch it some day when i'm free.One night i watched the first episode and its one and a half month later i have finished it and i feel so grateful that i had a chance to watch it.F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the best sitcom ever and i don't think any other sitcom can be made as great,amazing,fantastic,funny,emotional as this.It really is a roller coaster with cliffhangers in the last episode of every season which you cannot resist.every character of it is unique in their own way.I love all of them. I'm not sure who's my favorite. They all are so perfect.

Chandler is so loving and caring and funny throughout the 10 years.I love his jokes and one-liners he never stops to cheer everyone up even in the last emotional scene he doesn't stop.He's so sweet.I love his nervousness around people,his love for monica,his victory dance,his expressions,his relationship with joey and ross  and everything about him.

Monica is so beautiful from the 1st season till the 10th she looks so cute especially in her short hair.she totally is a beauty!I love her shrill,high-pitched,bossy noise when she's ordering everyone around,her in-your-faces,her stylish dressing,her leadership qualities,her tomboyish side,her physical strength,her organizing skills,her relationship with rachel,ross everyone and i love her romantic side,she's so sweet.Oh i just love her in every way!

Joey is so so so sweet and so caring,loving.He is a great friend,being loyal always except maybe when with Rachel,always advising.His dating never ends.I wish they would have shown what happened with him in future.He deserves the best as he is the best.i love his love for food and his innocence,his beefy,clueless nature.God! he's so cute!His expressions are just so exceptional when he realizes the thing after a decade and overall his expressions are the best.He proved he really is an actor.He is the child in the group and a little idiotic in a great way  but still women love him more than the other two men in the group.His hugging nature looks so cute on him.his relationship with everyone in the group is amazing.he is just an amazing guy.

Rachel is a fashionista.She is beautiful.I love her crying-at- ='' BUT THAT IS WRONG FRIENDS IS AMAZING"

Devansh Dua,0.0,"THE MOST HILARIOUS SHOW EVER!!!!

I've recently been watching a show named'FRIENDS'.It has been rated as one of the top American sitcoms ever.The genre of the show is comedy.This show aired in 1994 on NBC and since then it has been one of the greatest hits ever.The show was directed by James Burrows in association with Warner Bros and ended in 2004,lasting 10 seasons and breaking hearts of millions of fans.

The plot of the show revolves around the 6 main characters namely 'Ross','Rachel','Monica','Joey','Phoebe' and 'Chandler'.The spoiled but independent Rachel, the neat freak and formerly fat Monica, the goofy and lovable Chandler, the weird hippie Phoebe, the intellectual Ross, and the fun-loving Joey.The show also has a bit of romance in it and 2 of the characters even ended up getting married to each other.This show has taken the genre of comedy to a whole new level.This is one of the most hilarious shows I have ever seen, i mean if you watch it once, you‚Äôll laugh. You watch it 10 times, you‚Äôll still laugh.
Being one of the greatest shows ever,it has made careers for these actors and all of them are now one of the highest paid actors in the world.

The show teaches us how important the role of friends is in our daily lives that we don't even realise and at the same page the show is very relatable.It also teaches you that fights with friends are a part and parcel of life.They might hurt you, but there is no one else who will love you as much as they do.There is no other sitcom that can make you feel as wonderful as FRIENDS, because it‚Äôs a reflection of our lives- a story of 6 friends trying to find their way in the world, just like we are, and of finally making it. Their happy ending is the best happy ending anyone could ever ask for. The show may have ended, but the legacy will always remain,And that makes every FRIENDS fan ecstatic.

I would surely recommend this show to someone who loves comedy and lastly, I would say, go for it! It's one of those few TV series which would make you laugh, cry, feel loved, feel stupid, and think about how much of this happened in your life if you were one of them. And if you really love it, you'll cry buckets in the last episode. Didn't we all?"

Akash Savairam,5.0,"I'm just on 2nd season, & I already love this comic series, this is so special, everyone should watch it, first a few episodes and you're in love with it.

Whenever you feel stressed or overloaded with work and need a stress reliever, just watch one or two episodes & that's it! The series actually teaches us not to be too much serious in life, be simple, be cool and turst in self. All the characters in the series have distinct qualities, everyone has got some weird habits and style but that's what it teaches us, no matter how distinct you look in the crowd you should value your own speciality and not judge yourself with others.

My favorite character is of course Chandler Bing ! Cute guy with excellent humour. Ross is loving and caring, love his style of speaking. Monica is good, she knows she's little strict disciplined by nature but she tries not to impose her rules on others. Rachel is cute, beautiful, love her voice. Pheebs.. she is nice, good example of preserving any weirdness you own. Joey Tribbiani ! how can I forget this guy, always nice to his friends, honest and innocent, knows well how to catch girls.
All together this is a great treat. Simplicity is what makes the series so great. You shouldn't miss this one!"
Steven Solomon,5.0,"I loved them for now and for 10 years. When I was lonely, they were my ""Friends""...I feel like I know every one of them, as characters and the actors themselves. My crush on Jennifer Aniston (along with my disgust with Brad for their break-up), and my strange marvel at David Schwimmer's athleticism (as in the multi-hour catch sequence with Joey and later Monica), and his impromptu juggling were all outstanding. He was definitely my hero in the show, and of course I berated him for all the errors he committed during his courtship of Rachel. Yes, I am one of those incurable romantics that pledged if Ross wouldn't take her, I would certainly make myself available. But, as awkward as it seemed, I was always rooting for them. 

Schwimmer also was impressive as Robert Kardashian in ""The People v. O. J. Simpson"", replete with white hair tufts. He is an exceptional actor.

I also loved all of Matt LeBlanc's antics. He had to be a near-genius in his portrayal of the dim-witted Joey, but he was unquestionably my favorite source of humor. I loved his 5 Season show on Showtime, "" Episodes"", and look forward to more of his playing himself. 

And Lisa Kudrow was also a favorite for her portrayal of the unencumbered Phoebe with her singing to the accompaniment of Ross's bagpipes. What genius!

I am happy there will be a reunion. But since I have lived with them for all 16 years of syndication, I can go on in my limited spare time. Thank you all...You were definitely worth your outrageous salaries."
Fiona Baker,5.0,"One of the best and most heartwarming sitcoms ever. I watched this because of an edit I saw and I never regretted it after.

This show is handsdown one of the best sitcoms ever. I have watched many sitcoms before, like Big Bang, but this one truely changed my vision on love, friendship and life.

For one, the show is way ahead of its time, showing family issues, pregnancy situations and issues, LGBTQ+, being open with loved ones, mental disorders, different religions, and so much more, it really shows how different life is to everybody.

I also loved it because friends actually knows when to put laughing tracks. In the past I have watched some sitcoms, like Big Bang, where they will be in a serious situation and somehow always make a joke out of it. Friends doesn't do that, they have many serious situations (heartwarming, heartbreaking, etc), now sometimes they add jokes in serious situations but they actually know when its okay to add jokes to situations like that, which I think is really important for a sitcom.

Also, it really showcases how much you can love people, blood family or not, and how you can choose your own family, even if they are related to you or not. The 6 main characters love each other like family but only Monika and Ross are related.

I didn't like how quirky they made Monika's OCD but I do understand why they did, if they made it as serious as it is IRL it would've been a way darker show.

I also love the romances in the show, it really captivates how you can love many people at the same time or be stuck on someone you still love, etc.

I just had to make one more paragraph for Matthew Perry, RIP Matt, you were a legendary actor and you will never be forgotten.

Overall friends is an amazing show that is way over its time. If you watch it, you will never regret it."
Siddharth Chaturvedi,5.0,"AWESOME EXTRAORDINARY AND GR8, DEFINITELY REWATCHABLE ATLEAST 1 MILLION+ TIMES.
The females did excellent acting even when they had less screentime. But, the male leads are the real heroes of the friends. They never fail in doing hardwork and making you laugh a lot. Though, they don't act well like female leads but they are highly attractive with their performances.
THIS SERIES IS IMMORTAL AND WILL BE BECOMING VERY GREATER FOR THE NEXT THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
My country has 6 FRIENDS THEMED CAF√âS in Delhi, Kolkata, Bhuvaneshwar, Chandigarh, Pune, Gurgaon. But, there are opposite of this sitcom which is a trash:

How I Met Ur mother, This is us, Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99, Modern Family, Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Mom, Will And Grace
I found these names from Jayanth Bhandari 777 who rated it 1."
KAITLYN HORTON,5.0,"The show Friends is one of my favorite TV shows. It‚Äôs one of the funniest TV shows I have ever watched. Friends is about the lives of six unique adults who overcome different adventures and experiences which makes their lives both troublesome and entertaining. It is funny and the characters are developed very well. My favorite character is chandler because Chandler is a very good and thought-out character. The actor chosen was perfect for the part. All of the actors were chosen perfectly for the part. And all of the episodes were thought out and planned perfectly. It is really hard to get bored of that show. Every episode has its own problem and solution. It is a great show to watch in my free time. It has 10 seasons so it does take some time to watch. Once I started watching it I couldn‚Äôt stop watching it. The drama and the humor is really what I love most about it. I would rate this 5/5 stars because it‚Äôs the best show I have ever watched. The cast keeps the show interesting. And with the show lasting ten seasons, it never goes downhill. If you like comedy, romance, and drama this is the best show for that."
Ravi Chander,0.0,"LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
So basically this is one of best sitcoms I've ever seen. The way the story revolves around these six bestfriends, how they have this unbreakable bond with each other. Honestly I never get bored seeing this sitcom again and again.  So let us talk about the characters:
 Rachel is a total fashionista 
Monica is an organised freak 
Chandler is the king of sarcasm
Joey is sweet and flirty in front of every woman
Phoebe is weirdo but sweet and funny
Ross is the divorce force and also the dinosaur guy 
These characters basically present a basic life of a human alive now. This show basically made me feel all the feelings, I laughed,  cried and cheered but when this show ended I had that sad emotional feeling.  I'd really like to thank David Crane and Marta Kauffman for making such a wonderful sitcom and of course the actors for playing such magnificent roles.
Phoebe- Lisa Kudrow
Rachel- Jennifer Anniston 
Monica- Courteney Cox 
Ross- David Schwimmer 
Chandler- Matthew Perry 
Joey- Matt le Blanc
I would really like to recommend this show to everyone reading this review. And of course Janice and Gunther were the best. I still remember the way Janice laughed and Gunther's love for Rachel.
I love F.R.I.E.N.D.S !!üòçüòç"
sarvadnya mistry,0.0,"FANTASTIC!!! Well, to be honest, I never really thought that I would love any sitcoms more than HIMYM, Modern Family, TBBT, and many more before watching this. Just completed watching the last episode and, well, it's no surprise that it's one of the biggest sitcoms of all time. The series has a very unique chemistry that makes you watch the show even more. All the characters have such aura that you feel like they are not just a few characters in a T.V show but the people in real life who you know. The series is filled with love and humour. The series also reminds you of the importance of having friends in your life. 
Okay, now let's talk a bit about the actual series. It basically revolves around six friends with their unbreakable friendship living their lives in New York City. Helping each other through thick and thin, in relationships and personal life issues by always being there for each other.(That's the name of the title song too- 'I'll be there for you')
To make an extraordinarily successful series such as this, along with the powerful script, the casting of the series is a very important aspect which no doubt is PERFECT!!! The fact that Jennifer Aniston was the highest paid T.V actress in the world at that time she also had given birth to something called as 'Rachel Cut' hairstyle which became a trend overnight among girls. Not only her but all the actors including Courtney Cox, Latt Leblanc, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer made the show come to life. 

Well, it's not hypothetical to say that the show of this quality, you  MUST WATCH before you die.

Thank you!

My Ratings- 9/10"
Reeta Saini,5.0,"*Friends*, a timeless classic in the world of sitcoms, has earned its place as one of the most beloved shows of all time. It beautifully captures the ups and downs of life, love, friendship, and all the quirky moments in between. Set in New York City, the series follows a tight-knit group of six friends who navigate the challenges of adulthood with humor, heart, and endless wit. What makes *Friends* special is not just its hilarious one-liners but the deep emotional connections it portrays among its characters.

Two standout characters in the series are Phoebe Buffay and Rachel Green. Phoebe, with her eccentric charm and whimsical outlook on life, adds an element of unpredictability to the show. Her quirky personality, complete with her bizarre songs and unconventional wisdom, makes her an absolute joy to watch. She‚Äôs a free spirit, yet incredibly kind-hearted, bringing warmth to even the most absurd situations.

Rachel, on the other hand, evolves from a spoiled rich girl to a determined and independent woman. Her journey of self-discovery, from leaving her fianc√© at the altar to becoming a successful fashion executive, is truly inspiring. Rachel‚Äôs humor, fashion sense, and romantic struggles make her one of the most relatable characters on TV.

Together, Phoebe and Rachel add a dynamic mix of humor, heart, and growth to *Friends*, making it a must-watch for fans of all ages. Whether you're in it for the laughs or the emotional depth, *Friends* has something for everyone."
Hi hi,5.0,"WATCH IT! It‚Äôs amazing! The amazing cast keeps the story interesting and despite lasting 10 seasons, the writing never goes down hill. It follows 6 friends: Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), Joey Tribianni (Matt LeBlanc) and Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) as they make their way through their mid 20s to mid 30s. The story can be emotional at times especially in later seasons but it deals with them in mostly a light hearted way. Some scenes are tough to watch especially ones that aren‚Äôt for comedic effect as they are well acted and can really get to you. The comedy is really funny and like I said, the acting never gets worse and gets better throughout as the writers learn the characters. Some running gags and jokes are overused in the beginning but they learn to spread them out later on. I recommend this show for teens and up as some of the moments are mature. If you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, get yourself on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime etc and WATCH IT!"
Danish Javed,5.0,"Hi there!

I‚Äôm from Pakistan and have watched tons of series, but ""Friends"" holds a special place in my heart. It's hard to believe it has come to an end‚Äîjust thinking about it makes me a bit sad.

Whenever I‚Äôm feeling bored, I love to dive back into ""Friends."" It always lifts my spirits! The funny thing is, I find myself watching it slowly because I just don‚Äôt want it to end. That‚Äôs what makes it so special to me! The final scene, where everyone leaves the keys in Monica's apartment, really got to me. I wish it could go on forever!

I absolutely adore all the characters, but I have a soft spot for Matthew (Chandler). And like Joey, I can‚Äôt stand being hungry‚ÄîI just love to eat! Each character is so amazing in their own way. Honestly, I could talk about this series all day long. I wish I could meet any character in real life though. I never thought to meet any celebrity before. One line phoebe Buffey. You're amazing. Ross and Rachel, love face difficulties. Monica (A bond between all friends) 

It‚Äôs truly a legendary piece of television!"
Vaishnav R,0.0,"BEST SITCOM OF ALL TIME !!!!

This show is a COMEDIC GOLDMINE. Many shows have tried (and failed ) to replicate its magic. Though how I met your mother came close ,it didn't have the consistency in doling out good episodes every week like friends.And none can match the crackling chemistry this cast shared.The best thing about friends is its rewatchability. You can just watch it again and again and again and again.......
 
Sitcoms these days go for the odd smile or chuckle and instead try to show how smart they are . Friends really made you laugh loud and almost cry laughing. It still beats me how it was able to be so consistently funny throughout its ten season run. After each episode I'd come out with a smile on my face. 

A must watch is underrating it .If you haven't watched it till now, STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND START WATCHING IT."
SANA HAJARE,5.0,"Friends: The Timeless Comedy Classic
Friends is more than just a sitcom; it's a cultural phenomenon that has captured the hearts of millions worldwide. This iconic series follows the lives of six friends navigating love, careers, and life's challenges in the bustling city of New York.
The show's enduring appeal lies in its relatable characters, witty humor, and heartwarming moments. From the neurotic perfectionist Monica to the laid-back and lovable Joey, each character is uniquely endearing and brings their own flavor to the dynamic group. The chemistry among the cast members is undeniable, making their interactions feel genuine and authentic.
While some episodes may have aged better than others, the core of the show remains timeless. Its exploration of friendship, love, and personal growth resonates with audiences of all ages. Whether it's the iconic coffee shop banter, the unforgettable catchphrases, or the heartwarming storylines, Friends has something to offer everyone.
It's no wonder that the show continues to be enjoyed by new generations, proving that its impact on popular culture is undeniable."
lol listen to joji now,5.0,"Don't get me started on how perfect this freaking sitcom is. It is absolutely wonderful, flawless and outstanding. I have watched this show for years now binge watch after binge watch and I just cannot get enough of it. It has a perfect combination of it being funny, emotional, romantic and comforting. Not going to lie, I can usually choose my favourite characters in particular things but with Friends, I just cannot!

I love how they have different things about them; Monica's loving, sassy and funny temperament, Chandler's hilarious sarcastic ways and sayings, Rachel's passion, beauty and comical ways, Phoebe's interesting, amusing and love, Ross' crazy, funny, loving attitude and finally, Joey, Joey, Joey! There are no words to describe how amazing he is. I just love how through all their time together they stick by and love each other by being always there for one another. I love each relationship these friends have with each other."
Ava Converse,5.0,"OMG i cannot tell you a time where i wasn't watching friends. Its the best tv show out there even if it is from the 90s. I have seen every episode a billion times and i can't get enough. I love love love the show sooooo much. 

Ross is so funny and he is so protective over monica its sweet. Like at monica and chandlers wedding when chandler ran away, ross tackled him because he though he was leaving again. I love the way that Ross has loved rachel since they were in high school, and now here they are almost 30 and he still loves her.

Monica is so sweet. I love the fact that she has a specific way of cleaning and everything has to be done her way. I love monica she is so beautiful and bossy. If i ever met Monica Geller i would want to taste all of her food.

ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
Shady Z,5.0,"I guess there are probably obvious reasons to make this masterpiece The BEST comedy in the history. we're looking at one of the Best character developments which is a great element on the show for making us connect with each character as good as possible. the comedy , humor and sarcastic dialogues of each scene makes you laugh. even if the lines are not funny enough to make you laugh, the act and vibe of the show gonna make you do that and there is no way to escape from that. There is like everything on Friends, you gonna laugh with it, you gonna cry with it , you gonna live with it for a while and that period of your life will always be a memorable one and you'll be proud of yourself cause of the favor which you did to yourself by watching this tv show. if someone asks me to describe Friends in one sentence, I'm gonna say ""A Perfect and complete TV Show That Has Reached To Its Goal Of Making People Laugh"""
V S,5.0,"A must watch for every generation. It gives you hope, it makes you feel belonged, it takes away your anxiety and fears and finally brings you home. Friends is a statement in sitcoms for many many years to come. The 100 billion reruns across the globe, speaks volumes, how well-crafted this series is. You just can't get enough and would never want to watch the last episode. It makes you feel loved, cared and happy. It came out in 1994 and ended in 2004, but after 29 years, it is still fresh, amazing and true to heart. A heartfelt thank you to the creators for this amazing gift that makes you smile at the end of a hard day after work. It brings back your positive energy and makes you keep moving forward in life. It is going to stay long after we are gone. What an amazing cast who are masters of physical comedy. Grew up with it as a teenager and still loving it as an adult. Friends is home. Best thing to watch whenever you feel alone and down. Our Friends Forever."
Mita Barman Mandal,5.0,"today just at this moment i finished friends and i feel so sad that i have to say goodbye to all of them ...it's been almost a one year journey a great journey and i am happy how things ended up but i am little sad for joey tho but i hope he will also find a good ending . i am so so grateful to the whole crew of friends for providing us with these amazing series. It's just like i was living with them and been sharing all their happiness sadness , faced all these ups and downs together but so you know i don't think any series will make you  feel like a FAMILY . U guys might have heard the saying , 'THERE IS FRIENDS, THERE IS FAMILY AND THEN THERE ARE FRIENDS THAT BECOME FAMILY.' It's totally like that just as u know friends started with rachel having issues with family and these guys welcomed her chandler already was friends with them and monica welcomed him in her life phoebe was the craziest person i have ever seen they still loved her and her craziness i mean who does that for a friend but they accepted her and welcomed her see that makes them a complete FAMILY . goodbye"

Cheshta Malik,5.0,"MUST WATCH!! F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is FAMILY. I can't even put in words how much I am attached to this sitcom. This is just a pure and funny moment the six friends experience in New York. As you'll go through this story, you'll feel as if you're a part of their friend group. this gives us a feeling of emotional attachment and comfort. As I had heard many people say, that this show become your comfort how. I completely agree! The sense of relaxation this gives me is just undefined. I remember myself crying my eyes out when it ended because I has seen it all and the next moment I had a big smile, ofcourse I had started this show again. You are not going to regret the time you put on this show. TRUST ME! GO FOR IT!
The best part about it is that it does not show any typical filmy plot. The entire story is filled with realism and is easy to relate to (comfort, I told you). It shows both the ups and downs of all the characters and how they get through with this. Anyways, I'll go and replay it. Bye."

Sambhav Arora,0.0,"This show is the Best Show for me regardless of Genre or Language. I know that this show actually need no intro and that there have multiple reviews of this show but still I am writing this review anyway. Honestly I didn't knew what this show was for obvious reasons which is that I wasn't even born till the 3rd season of this show. I had this in my watchlist on Facebook since 2010 and I even was following its page, but never watched a single episode until 5 years ago when I first thought to watch this show after reading an article on in its 20th Anniversary in 2014. And since that day I can't even recall how many times I watched this amazing show. In reality I am you can say a 'Loner' but this show made me realise the importance of Friends. I cried and I laughed, I got so immersed in this show that I even wanted to go to New York of 90s and have a Coffee in the Central Perk. I love each of the Six Friends, the Sarcastic Chandler, the Goofy Actor Joey, the Eccentric and Aloof Phoebe, the Overly Competitive Monica, the Dino Man ""Who was on a Break"" Ross and the Brat but Sweet Rachel. Though my personal Biases are definitely Chandler Bing, Rachel Green and Joey Tribbiani (who BTW doesn't share his food ;) ). I just love this show. 

In conclusion all I can say is that I don't think that there's a single person who doesn't love this show once they've watched this and to those who haven't watched it yet please grab your TV remote, PC, Smartphone and watch this show now cuz you're missing something big time!"
Shravan Vallaban,5.0,"This is by far the best sitcom I have ever watched. Having watched other immensely successful sitcoms like the office, I would ascertain the character development in friends is incredible. Most of the characters except Rachel, by the end of the show, did not change their nature from what it was at the beginning of the show. There were too many moments that were emotionally connected to me and that's where David and Marta Kaufmann have played their part. Monica has this finicky character which some of the audience might not like but her other aspects more than make for it. 

Initially, Chandler's character looked the most comical during the first two seasons but after that Joey's character stood out to best in the series throwing up with instantaneous jokes that would tickle most of the bones in our body.

The scene where Joey is asked to describe the relationship between Monica and Chandler and add something about love, he consciously uses alliteration with loving....sharing.....giving....taking.... even after he inadvertently uses a better description of how they meant to him. That is the best scene of the series.

Go, check out the tidbits from IMDB which are interesting but don't read them before you watch the show as they contain spoilers."
Amelia Chalus,0.0,"This is honestly the best tv show I have ever watched, this show got me through thick and thin, sad days and happy days, sick days and healthy, rainy and sunny I can still watch it over and over with out getting bored and it makes me laugh and cry and cheer and when it ended I felt a sad emotional feeling that I‚Äôve never felt before in a movie or tv show. I‚Äôm very glad my sister showed me it other wise my life would not be complete, this show is my family ( of course with my real family). I would like to thank David crane and Marta cauffman for creating this masterpiece and to thank the producers for building it and of course the actors for playing the magnificent characters

TV Critics,5.0,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHOW EVERRRR. 

Seriously, Friends is by far my favorite sitcom. It's so beautifully written and all the actors have done an amazing job with their characters. All of them are consistently funny. This show balances well the comedy and the emotional moments very well. 

It represents a group of people who love each other and are there for each other at all times. And they forgive each other's mistakes no matter what. And that's a really beautiful thing. 

Chandler remains funny throughout, Monica remains nice and beautiful and her personality is charming, Rachel becomes funnier as the seasons go and I loved watching her character growth, Pheobe remains one of the funniest friends and she's charming and Joey is so sweet an kind. All six bring something special to the table and I love it so much."
celia garcia,5.0,"Though the format was scripted,  conversations were candid and spontaneous.  The actors did not disappoint: all 6 of them seemed true to characters they played, but they also exuded real personal affection for each other. Some of the scripted parts seemed forced, like the fashion walk or pop-ups with celebrities unrelated to the original program and only diminished the time devoted the main actors. But overall, it was a poignant get together.
It was a reunion as emotional to me and other avid fans, as it probably was to the actors who were just like our long missed friends. We knew people in that show for ten years, laughed and cried with them, loved  and hoped with them, and for 30 minutes a night in each of the 52 weeks of those years lived their stories with them. Thank you to Rachel and Ross and Monica and Chandler and Phoebe and Joey and everybody in the show who created the collective experience with us viewers and shared those sweet moments in life we would always carry in us."
Tanushree upadhya,0.0,Words are not enough to explain this series and how much it means to me how much it's close to my heart. When m sad I watch friends when m happy I watch friends when m worried I watch friends.m so glad that I got to watch such a great series and at the same time I feel sad that I have finished it so many times that now I know every scene in the series. If any one of you are reading this just to decide whether to watch it or not then please don't even give a second thought to this series just go for it and trust me you will be so glad afterwards that you watched it. It is amazing.you feel that you are emotionally connected to each characters. You won't be able to believe even for a second that those characters are fictional.i can go on and on about this but let's just stop this for now bcz i gotta watch an episode of friends now‚ô•Ô∏è.
Lisa Griffin,5.0,"there are no words to describe the amazing show that is friends !!! ive beenwatching friends since I was 2 and I'm 15 now but any way, I am in all about this show, it makes you feel emotions that you didnt know you had. My whole life has basically been revoled around this show I know every line to every episode and I'm not ashamed. This show makes you laugh,cry,scream with joy,feel angry, upset, mad ,but all around happy !!! If I could watch one show for the rest of my life I would have to watch Friends ! Not only has this show been in my life since the beginning but its played a big part in my upbringing and i feel as if I'm am a better person and more humble and understanding of life and the real world because of it !! I feel everyone can relate alot to all the characters Rachel: lost and unsure of the world around her Monica: Career driven and uptight Ross: hopeless romantic Phoebe: different and optimistic Joey:loveable and always hungry Chandler: hard headed and sarcastic and loveable but hard to love . Theres much more to each of these amazing characters but I would have to right a book to say everything. So to end this I would like to say if you have not watched friends please go and. do so it will change your life for the better !!"
Aishni Sharma,5.0,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the best series I've ever watched and it will always be the best in the future. I was not even born when this series was shot but still it feels like mon,joe,bing,rach,ross,pheebs are in their 20s and they are chilling at central perk having coffee. I think this is the only series which have received so much love worldwide. I am never gonna stop watching it. It's like a cycle you start from season 1 to season 10 and then again from season 1 to season 10. This series will always be close to my heart. It seems like these characters haven't aged at all. It acts like a total mood changer always, whenever you feel low or in a bad mood just watch 1 or 2 episode of any season and you could feel like everything's so fun. This is the only series in which every character is my favourite , i cannot choose between these 6 people. I just love it and its a must watch. love you mon joe bing rach pheebs ross."
Koda Arnold,5.0,"I have been a die hard fan Since my father got me watching my first episode as a child.
My hands down favorite show of all time.
It is both funny and emotional and shows what real friendship is supposed to be..
Chandler and joey make the show funny and charming while ross and rachel show what love can be like, a rollercoaster of emotion. All the characters bring something special Individually but all of them together make a legendary show. Thank you all for an amazing show cast. I have the entire box series and watch it religiouslyü§£

And R.I.P to the amazing Matthew Perry, You truly made the show a charming sarcastic fun time that everyone loves... thanks for all the laughs. You are a true legend and The only celebrity death, I actually tried over.

Sivapriya Kamat,5.0,"No matter how many times u watch, it is as funny as the first time
I have lost count as to how many times I've watched this series. For me personally it is almost like therapy because whenever i feel sad or low, i watch Friends episode. 
Following are the reasons that make friends unique and a  masterpiece:
1. It is a sitcom that combines different types of comedy (sarcasm - mostly from chandler, quirky and comical - mostly from phoebe and joey, realistic - mostly from ross and rachel)
2. All 6 characters of the main cast are well developed. Each one of them has shown significant character growth throughout the series
3. Each one of the six main characters have unique and well developed dynamic with each one of the other 5. These are a treat to watch."
Jeevani Khorana,5.0,"I really like Friends because even when i'm sad they always manage to make me happy no matter. Even though i watched this show a couple thousand times it still manages to take me by surprise and make me laugh. No matter what people say, Friends is probably the best show that ever existed because even besides the humor it shows how much they care about each as if they were one person. It always happens in the show where they have family issues when they're real family is each other. Everyone has their opinion and this is my opinion saying how much i love friends and wish my life was like this."
Juli√°n Lado,5.0,"One of the best sitcoms ever
After seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous, but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future. All six of the friends bring characteristics to the show that make the viewer feel like they know them. Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.

I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked.

I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone."
wemeye dalu,0.0,"I hardy give reviews on shows! But friends is different! And in some ways very personal.  I started watching friends when I was in Junior high, I have gone on to get my undergrad and worked for close to four years, and FRIENDS is still undoubtedly the very best. Here is why I think it has stood the test of time; it‚Äôs list of directors are some of the best, James Burrows stands out for me, haven directed shows like CHEERS and FRASIER. The writing was very good, all six main characters where written well, even though there were moments when I felt Matt LeBlanc‚Äôs character could‚Äôve been written better. The six season regulars, where directors actors! They brought everything to the character and allowed us to fall in love with them! And boy did We! Matthew Perry‚Äôs character was the funniest for me and David Schwimmer‚Äôs character had the best expressions! I‚Äôm sure I have watched each episode of friends at least a million times, hahahahaha. It‚Äôs the BEST of the BEST."
Siri T. Fauske,0.0,"NO JOKE, BEST TV SHOW IN THE WORLD!! HANDS DOWN, A PIECE OF ART!!!

Satrughan Prasad,5.0,"This show is just awesome itself. I always saw my friends posting about it on stories, writing about how good it is. I always wondered why they were so crazy about a 1994 sitcom. What is so good about it??One day I saw my elder brother watching it and I asked him what is so funny and then he told me when you'll watch it you'll know it . One day I felt so bored and I had nothing to do. So I started scrolling on netflix and then I found ""Friends"" and then I started watching it boredom. As I was watching the 1st eoisode, I went on and on. I never laughed that hard for years and then I understood why everyone is so crazy about it. And now I myself is a crazy fan of this show. I love the way Joey flirt with girls and his iconic line""How gou doin??"",that particular line and hid expressions always make me laugh till I cry. I love every character on the show. I love Chandler for his sarcastic jokes, Monica for her discipkine and love, Rachel cod her naughtiness,flirty nature, Phoebe for her positive vibes, funand chill and Ross for his kind ,loving and caring nature. Oh God I can't stop writing about this show. I'll just reccomend that if you're stressed, bored,sad,happy watch this show .It's a whole mood changer"
Nadja Grujic,5.0,"In my opinion, this is the best sitcom ever! I love how every character is unique and funny. Rachel and Joey are my personal favorites but the rest are really great as well. My whole family has watched the entire show at least 50 times, and they all love it. Friends is just as fun to watch the first time, as it is the last. All of the seasons of the show are amazing. Me and my brother started watching the show when we were 10 years old, so i think it is perfectly fine for kids of that age to be watching it. Yes, it may have a few inappropriate scenes here and there, but most of it is pretty family friendly. 

Overall, this show has got good humor, good characters, and is very iconic. I highly suggest watching it, especially to people who like sitcoms."
Nathan Govender,5.0,"10000000000 ‚≠êÔ∏è stars! Excellent Show! just finished watching all 10 seasons and I loved it! Amazing Characters each with a different personality giving everyone someone to relate too! Love it! Love it! I would watch it again fro sure üíØüíØ Everyone should watch this show during lockdown! I‚Äôm already feeling so disconnected after finishing it! It‚Äôs amazing! If you watch it you won‚Äôt go wrong for sure üòâ You will love everything the coffeehouse, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross, Rachel and Phoebe. Apartment 19 & 20 every single thing, just trust me and go watch it, F.R.I.E.N.D.S was the best tv show ever, after 25 years, it will always have a place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Nafia Haque Muskan,5.0,"THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!
F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the show which I can guarantee that it will make u laugh! FOR SURE!The best part of F.R.I.E.N.D.S is that u can literally click on amy episode and end up laughing which, also, makes it different from other shows. It sure contains some sad events but the sadness is balanced by adding something funny(unlike other shows). It has literally everything: friendships, relationships, and etc many more. The most amazing part of this show is it respected every kind of relationships like straight, gay back at that time. So in comedy, I personally dodon't think any tv series will ever be able to beat F.R.I.E.N.D.S"
Jessica Rowley,5.0,"‚ÄúSo no one told your life was gonna be this way‚Äù friends is a romantic comedy show that will keep you laughing for to the end. You may not like the word romantic, but it is about friendship, loyalty and sarcasm that will keep you laughing for days. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. The humour is universal. You will be following six reckless adults living in New York. Friends is a super smart sophisticated comedy that looks into the hearts and minds of the six amazing, over- the- top characters. There is nothing that can cheer me up like this show on a full day of endless work. The humour, the characters, the detail. I have watched every episode A LOT of times and yet I still laugh at the same joke. But don‚Äôt worry ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there for you!‚Äù"
Frager White,5.0,"This show is the best sitcom ever to be shown on tv. I didn't grow up with it but I had seen parts of it on youtube and I finally watched it. This show is so sad but at the same to so funny and beautiful and romantic. It's like the tv version of comfort food XD.

Chandler is so sweet. Everything about him is either funny or sweet, His victory dance, and his friendship with Joey, his on-off relationship with Janice, which finally turned off again. I love how he was brave enough to at least try and quit his job and smoke for his friends. He had a bad childhood but he turned around and began using jokes as a defense mechanism and tried his best to make a happy life for himself."
Jo Go,0.0,"Friends is an incredible sitcom! It mainly focuses on six main characters: Rachel (fashionista), Monica (organized), Chandler (comical), Joey (sweet), Phoebe (weird), and Ross (the Divorce Force). These characters represent all the people alive, each with their own characteristics. This show is especially amazing since there are touching moments as well as funny moments. These characters seem so real as they are not in an imaginary world. As they grow older, they face many of the challenges we have today and since there are no phones for texting, snap chatting, instagramming, etc. they talk so much and tell hilarious stories. There is always an ongoing plot so that the fan will continue to watch to find out but each episode, whether upsetting or downright hilarious has its own special quirks. There have been many imitations of this show but the expectations never live quite up to this show.
My favorite characters are:
1. Chandler (at his best from s2 to s6)
2. Joey (at his best from s3-s10)
3. Monica (at her best from s1 to s7)
4. Phoebe (at her best from s1-s3, s7-s8)
5. Rachel (at her best from s1-s3, s9)
6. Ross (at his best s1, flashbacks)"
Mahzabin Khan,5.0,"Phoebe, having such a bad childhood with her father leaving her as soon as she was born, mother dying from suicide and her suffering in poverty with lack of any affection but yet struggles outta it and turns out to be so optimistic and happy. It will teach you that no matter how your life is, happiness solely depends on yourself and the way you perceive it. She is so quirky and weird in a good way it will basically make you wanna lead her life. 

Rachel, being the spoiled child of a doctor but leaving every leisure and silver spooning behind, she comes to NYC and starts her life afresh. Also her character development throughout the whole season, how she was a waitress at first and finally achieved her dreams being so successful in fashion industry and adapting with every situation that came in her way will teach you it's okay to start your life newly! And you need to blow in order to grow. (xD) And it makes us realise what Monica meant to Rachel while welcoming her to home in the 1st episode, ""Welcome to the real life. It sucks! But you are gonna love it.""
It is all about the situations and complications from their daily life, their job/dating life/career/personal life and friendship. How they handle them, how they love each other and stand by each others side no matter what! What sacrifices they make for each others happiness. It is so simple yet so amusing! You will never get bored of watching it. I have never given any reviews before but this sitcom just touches your heart and all the characters rooted to it. It is my 2nd time watching this sitcom. I have replayed all the 10 seasons twice but still when it's about to end, it feels like they are taking a piece of your heart with them!"
Isabella Turner-Garcia,5.0,"Friends is the best show i have ever watched. It is so funny. Please make a friends reunion.

Monica-
Is so pretty. Whatever she wore she looked amazing in.

Rachel-
Is so pretty. She has never stopped being pretty. Jennifer is my Fave actress. If i had one dream that would be to meet Jennifer Aniston.

Chandler- 
Is so funny. He's jokes never get old

Joey-
He is funny in his own way.

Phoebe-
is kind.

Ross-
Is to smart which makes it funny as well as seeing everyone reacting.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S-
was such a big hit. It is a great show they have to make more seasons. Make your fans happy and make more friends season.
What happened to Ben and Emma
What happened with Ross and Rachel
What happened with the apartment
What happened to Monica and Chandler
What happened to Monica and Chandler's Twins

Now I know why do people love friends this much. This is an awesome show which make you feel happy. Miss you guys. I would like to thank the whole team of FRIENDS for making this awesome show.

And the team behind the camera a big round of applause for you guys. I am writing this in 2018 so you can understand how good is this show that people are still loving this. Thank you guys"
Aleesha,0.0,"When I started watching friends, I couldn't even believe that it was casted 20 years ago. It is and will always be my favorite. Ross is a three times divorced person. He is a very caring person. His sister Monica Geller is a perfectionist. She always takes in charge of things. Rachel Green is a sweet lady who sometimes couldn't recognize her soulmate when he was around her. Joey Tribbiani funny and always support you. Chandler Bing is funny, caring person. Phoebe Buffay a crazy, caring, creepy kind of person,  in a good way. Everyone will wish to have friends like them. ""I'll be there for you"" freshen our mind before the episode. No other sitcoms have even come near a little bit close to F. R. I. E. N. D. S.

Shruti Singh,5.0,"Best sitcoms of all time.
Such an outstanding, amazing, fantastic, and hilarious show.this show is a rollercoaster of friendship, love, emotions, feeling and so many things.this show would actually taught you what friendship is about.there are '6' F.R.I.E.N.D.S in the show who always stand together for each other no maater what.these 6 characters are totally different from one another and each one make you laugh. every character have his own and very unique personality which I like the most.i know there are many episodes and I was also confused earlier should I watch or not but trust me when you will start watching it you won't stop.

Highlyyyyyyyyyyy recommended."
Alexa Creasey,5.0,"This Tv show is the best sitcom ever. I remember when it first came to Netflix 5 years ago and my elder sister was watching it she got me to watch it and I thought i would hate it but I loved it and i love the cast of friends watching their friendship grow beautifully over 10 seasons was a pleasure to watch. the comedy itself is top-notch and very entertaining despite some jokes being old. I've watched it 4 times now all the way through and each time is wonderful to watch now and again. The characters Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey and Ross are brilliantly written well and props to the cast who made this wonderful show for the fans."
Jamie Bonk,5.0,"There's a show I watch call FRIENDS. I absolutely love that show. I laughed, cried. Friends are very important to you in life besides your family. When you have a problem with something your friends are there for you no matter what you going through, especially hard times. That is the point of being a friend. Thanks to the actors who get along very well in the show. I love the whole cast. Monica Geller, Ross Geller, Rachel Green, Chandler Bing, Phoebe Buffay, and Joey Trribain have a awesome relationship in the show and off set too. They are a family. My friends are very important to me. The cast are very important to me they are like best friends to me. They could understand what I am going through. They are a great team. All thanks to Courtney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, and Matt LeBlanc for being a awesome cast. Thanks to Marta Kauffman and David Crane who created this show. Friends would not be a show without these 2 amazing creators."
remy gladson,5.0,"It's literally the best show ever with lots of melodrama, romance and comedy. An even mixture of said elements keeps the viewer hooked to the screen and left wanting for more. There is a fantastic balance of humour and seriousness flooding the atmosphere when ever one watches the show leaving you anxious and sometimes gives you the relief you wanted. I find this show so relaxing to watch especially whenever I come home from a hard day of work. Just watching Joey's stupidity or Chandler's humour or Ross's seriousness,Rachel's carelessness, Monica's emaculatenes and finally Phoebe's crazy behaviour cracks me up whenever and wherever. If you're just wanting to start watching some sitcom, I would suggest you start with Friends. Trust me, you won't regret it. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Bebe Weter,5.0,"This show is perfection. People have said that this show was a parody off of Living Single, but what this show and Living Single don't have in common is that there is diversity in this Friends compared with Living Single, it's just only black people (which is sort of a cliche if you ask me. The show also gets boring bc it's just another show about living in the hood)  

Friends always challenged the stereotypes of what life is like and was always breaking boundaries when it came to their story lines and helped many people in the world who were struggling with their own problems, Friends manage to pull them out of their funk and put a smile on their faces cause the show was almost representing what real life would be like when we get into our 20s. ( Minus the rent controlled apartment, and amazing jobs, and exciting love life.) It showed that no matter how hard life is, Friends will be there to pick you up and help you gain the courage to after in what you believe in."
Abhijit Basak,0.0,"Ooo I just finished the greatest sitcom ever made.ok,not just me ,me and my partner watched it together.And its one of the best thing that happened to us.It made us laugh and cry ....and we have gone through a range of emotions in the span of ten seasons of the show.
Friends shows us to not take our life too seriously and sometimes enjoy the small moments.every character of this show gave us some life lessons.
My better half and I both watch very different kind of shows .It is the only show that we both loved .And that's the beauty of friends.
I would recommend you to watch it with someone you love and this will give you a new meaning of love, I bet you that.
Best of luck from Diya and Abhi"
kerala blasters,5.0,"Friends is number first sitcom that I've ever seen.those six characters has shown the perfect friendship and caring for each others which makes it more special. it can bring a very good relaxation even in the toughest situation when we watching it. every time i watch it i feel more relaxed and it also helped me when i am going through depression.Till now i cannot believe how they managed the whole series just in three apartments and a coffee shop. And b y the way it is a lot funny actually.without any doubt i can say that it is my ""favorite series"".love the friends.it can make you laugh even in the hardest situations"
Rao Zeeshan Afzal,5.0,"I think it is one of the best play that you will ever watch. The feelings they had for each other were just breathtaking.The relationship among the friends was full filled with love, care and fun. They go through a lot of upps and downs but they had never jeopardized their friendship at any cost. There is no masquerading in the show, everyone had perfectly done its job. The direction, story, screenplay and production also deserves an applause for creating such a masterpiece. In short this sitcom is worth watching."
adiba zehra,5.0,"BEST THING EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE.
It is the best sitcom ever.MUST WATCH.
i love the way how their life has been represented and the characters are amazing.
its not just some comedy mystical series, yeah there are some of the things which are really hard to believe but the show is filled with reality on other side.
The series clearly shows that LIFE IS NOT PERFECT ALL THE TIME, YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY OR ANOTHER TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS AND SOMETIMES HAVE TO IGNORE SOME FREAKING SMALL THINGS.
The end is heart wrenching ,i didn't want it to end but..........  :))"
Anjana Raman,5.0,"This sitcom is the greatest of all time. It has characters you love right from the start, funny lines, warm, cozy sets, and such an aura of love and friendship. This show has touched so many people‚Äôs lives, and will certainly make a mark on yours. These people have a way of making you feel like one of them. You feel like you‚Äôre accompanying them on their daily trips to Central Perk, lounging on the recliners with Chandler and Joey, and laughing and joking along with the six Friends. The plot is hilariously funny, includes plot twists you‚Äôd never expect, and paint all six characters‚Äô personalities in the best light possible. This show is amazing and so, so, uplifting. It is truly a blessing to watch."

Laughter
Caring
Happiness
Sadness
Anger
Love
Honesty
Sympathy
Integrity
Wierdness
& Much more even when time pass all the way this show will never get old for generations to come will watch and learn many things from this show.

The craftmanship of the characters that the story revolves around are mainly the six friends living in New York sharing their small world and living happily forever and always support each other and are there for each other.
 
Best show ever made and broadcasting community must consider it streaming all the way around the world through Television medium again."
Divya devoo,0.0,"This show is love ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cracks you up when you are going through a bad day or a bad phase plus it is relatable you can repeat it like a million times you would laugh hard even when you know what and which joke is coming up. It's nostalgia it's fun it's amazing
It has pure and simple comedy generally banters between friends. From Jennifer Aniston's hair do to janice's laugh or oh my God or Monica's I know!!! Or any of Chandler's sarcastic comments. This show has it all and when you have finished watching it entirely the only thing you would is to watch it again because it gets better and better everytime. 
I would suggest it to anyone regardless of gender, nation,race this is pure comedy and no wonder it is rated one if the best and popular sitcome ever"
Ilsa B,5.0,"Five stars to Chandler Bing.... it's ok Matthew, I know the truth about your death. To the cast and crew who are good, your dear friend was murdered. To the evil who knows the same truth I do... shame on you because you were never a part of the grander plan and you should have chosen to follow God but you follow the devil like a lost puppy instead. I was trained to know much of what I know and even without so much of a first grade education I'm very smart and can solve many puzzles to figure things out. This is God's world, my crazy Bramer family and every other family trying to take over the world are living a pipe dream üôèüíï if you are a female, we will all be erased because they want only mankind roaming the earth. You don't have brown eyes and brown hair? Your on the same hit list. Are you German but also other ethnicities? Yup you're on there too. My serial killer father trained me to know the whole plan of what he was allowed to know. He doesn't realize he too is on that same exact list!

Shivani Jain,5.0,"This is the best sitcom I've ever watched in my life..! The comedy is light hearted, the characters are amazing and of course the acting was absolutely astounding. Especially love the cafe set üòâ Everyone should watch this series at least once in their life (they won't be able to just watch it once since it's sooo goood!). The best thing about this show is that it normalizes what one faces in the journey of independence - being away from family, and shows us that it's ok to move forward at your own pace.. Wonderful show! ‚ôæÔ∏è/10 rating!!"
Tadiwa ‚ÄúTBK‚Äù Kasinganeti,5.0,"Friends is a show that I never had an interest in seeing when I was younger. I thought it was overrated and I thought the name was so vague. But now I'm older and I watched it......ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS OF MY LIFE. Love this show so much. It's funny, clever and the cast has amazing Chemistry. It has so many iconic episodes and some TOP TIER humor. Even without the laughter track I'd die laughing. Even though season 8 to 10 are a little weaker than the rest, they're sooo much better than most shows of today. They're still very rewatchable. And the FINALE IS EVERYTHING. Also, Janice is my favorite running gag LOL . #Oh My GOD! 10 out of 10. My favourite show of all time"
Keyanna Arora,5.0,"THE BEST SITCOM EVERRR!! okay I get it 10 seasons are a lot! in but in friends, I want some more I can't believe it I finished them all in 1 month my friend was addicted to it and kept saying that watch it!! I finally gave It a shot and I couldn't like it more!! all of the actors and the actresses acted really well and were perfect for this series!! and especially my favorite actors and actresses were so 1st goes to Lisa Kudrow [phoebe buffay] and second goes to Matthew perry [chandler bing] and third of course Matt Leblanc [joey tribbiani] and all the rest were perfect too!! and I loved them all but these 3 really inspired to be cool funny cute AND ESPECIALLY, of course, FUNNY AND COOL!! so keep it up!! love you all!"
Aryan Singh,5.0,"First off when I started watching this sitcom I did put it on a break as it was boring. But after watching a million instagram reels I thought to start again from them till now has been a splendid journey. I really liked the theme of the show which was that what would happen there will be for each other even in real lives. This show tell us the real meaning of friends to support each other in time of crisis. People who don't like this sitcom it's okay because comedy is subjective. I read some reviews where someone wrote that it was very wrong of Phoebe to mug Ross in his teen. But have they realised that she lived on streets so she did it to mainly feed her hunger but later when she knows she asked for an apology from Ross.
It's too much but it was as great show and √≠ enjoyed it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Maeve Smith,5.0,"I think that you can learn from all the characters and that watching friends is a great way to escape from reality!

Monica 

Is very neat, organised and competitive but at the same time has a loving heart and a sweet personality!


Rachel

Is very into her looks and her hair and a great fashionista. She is also very considerate! 

Phoebe

Very positive and helpful. She gives great massages and is a great friend to joey! 

Joey

Loves his food. very sweet and funny and is a heart full character! 

Chandler

Funniest person you would ever meet and is great with sarcastic comments and cheering you  up!

Ross

Loves dinosaurs and palaeontology. But also is loving and funny as well as having to always be right! 


Love the show it‚Äôs the best thing I ever watched 12 times through!"
lexie skot,5.0,"Friends is the best show ever! watch it, you will 100% not regret it. I learnt heapsss from it. 

it's so relatable, and it just makes you feel good and happy.

 If you're having a bad day,(I'm honestly not joking) watch Friends, it will definitely cheer you up. 

There is not ONE episode where you can't laugh, even if theres a sad moment or episode (COUGH, when Ross and Rachel broke up- the first time not the hilarious second time-), there will always be that one line that makes you laugh again.

Some people arent bothered to watch this show, but honestly its helped me a lot through my life. (take that from a 13 and a half year old girl)

p.s Ross and Rachel are better than Roey, just thought i'd share!"
Adnan ansari,4.0,"The series is fun to watch. You will live all the characters' stories you gonna enjoy and Start to imagine their lives. But dialog writing for the character Phoebe is bit weak. So many places you won't laugh when she cracks a joke, her story is also over imaginative which feels unreal also . Joey is the character I like the most because of his realistic story and at some places strong comic timing. Chandler one liners are hilarious but sometime you might feel not needed. The other characters also played their parts very well. Yes I would recommend this series if you haven't watched it yer"
Amir Dabaghian,0.0,"Friends (1994-2004)
The Friends is a sitcom TV series, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston and five other actors and actresses. Warner Bros Company earns one billion dollars and wins some awards from this series. There is no special effect because of its kind of film.
The series was set in New York in the 1990s and 2000s. It was filmed on location in Bros studio, Burbank, and California.
The series is about three young men and three young women who live in a building. They are between 20-30 years old. They are looking for job occupations, making dates, breaking up, solving challenges, and other routine acts. They help each other in different ways and also they help others. They spend all of their free time together and sometimes discuss about their experiences during the day.
I don‚Äôt recommend the Friends. Some plots in the series are repeated again and again such as their dating. There are no continuations story and every episode has an individual story (maybe because of the film kind). It is comedy, drama, but for foreign audience is not very fun, because some idioms and phrases are used in this series is funny for American audiences."
 ö flurrelia …û ‚ÄúMaya‚Äù,3.0,"There‚Äôs been a fair bit of controversy over Bill Condon‚Äôs live-action remake of Disney‚Äôs animated 1991 classic Beauty and the Beast, mostly centered over Condon‚Äôs proclamation that he‚Äôs given Disney its first canonically, openly gay character. In an interview with Attitude, Condon described that character, the villain‚Äôs sycophantic sidekick LeFou, as if his sexuality was a significant, foregrounded part of the plot, and as if it ultimately arrived at some major moment of truth:

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs confused about what he wants. It‚Äôs somebody who‚Äôs just realising that he has these feelings. And [actor Josh Gad] makes something really subtle and delicious out of it. And that‚Äôs what has its payoff at the end, which I don‚Äôt want to give away. But it is a nice, exclusively gay moment in a Disney movie.‚Äù

But when it arrives, that ‚Äúnice, exclusively gay‚Äù moment is a one-second shot of LeFou in a fancy ballroom-dance finale, accidentally shoved into the arms of a nameless man who‚Äôs wearing drag because of an earlier sight gag. It isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúexclusively gay moment,‚Äù it‚Äôs about a dozen vaguely campy frames. Much like Finding Dory‚Äôs controversial, much-ballyhooed ‚Äúlesbian couple‚Äù ‚Äî two women who appeared in a extremely brief, silent reaction shot in the film ‚Äî LeFou is all PR blitz and no actual payoff. But the tepidness of this built-up moment hasn‚Äôt stopped the predictable backlash, from online complaints to an Alabama theater noisily pulling the film from its lineup (proving the bigoted old chestnut ‚Äúwhy are they pushing their views on us‚Äù is still alive and well in the world) to Malaysia banning the film. To Disney‚Äôs credit, the company has refused to recut the film to appease Malaysian censors, which is an admirably principled stand to take over a single second of footage."

Hi my Name is Anna and I love friends but they took it off Netflix I have heard all my friends talking about it its terrible friend is like the happiness of are day you are sad watch friends its like it has always been my backup I think that you shouldn't take it off you should put it back on right now because well people are dying to see that show even if they already have in their spare times imagine all the people watching it having fun cheering up from being upset or sad friends.

Kriti Sharma,5.0,"This sitcom is the best sitcom I have watched in my whole life. It is Amazing. I love their friendship and each and every moment is very funny. At the last episode, there are some sad moments which made me cry but the rest were good. I think F.R.I.E.N.D.S deserves to get an oscar award. It's so romantic, funny, sweet. All the 6 characters, Jennifer Aniston (Rachel), Courteney Cox (Monica), Matt Le Blanc (Joey), David Schwimmer (Ross), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe) and Mathew Perry (Chandler), you guys did an amazing job. The theme song, ""I'll be there for you"", is an amazing song. I love the title because this is how best friends should be. I am waiting for the reunion.  üòçüòçüòçüíïüíïüíïüíïü•∞ü§£ü§£"

Abhilash,1.0,"I'd probably give less than one star for this stupid show, I know it's all comedy show & should be taken as fun

But what is fun? Rachel runs away from marriage, then sleeps with Barry twice in his hospital, then dates Paolo, realizes love for Ross, then sleeps with Paolo as Ross is with Julie, then dates other people, convinces Ross to have sex with her while dating Tag, then realizes feelings for Joey, kisses him & wants Ross to understand.

What can of sicko will take it as fun?

Why can't you talk to Ross on face? I don't know what drugs the writer took while writing the script

They disrespect Indian tradition in S8 E8, 10:43

Literally Garbage

The story-line was really good when it started, 6 friends living together & support each other in needy situations to get out of trouble.

The show should have ended for 6 seasons, then it gets really weird, I would say that show should have either ended within 5-6 season or the writers should have innovated, instead the production house decided to earn more money & then the writers could not bring up with new content, so they have decided to introduce more & more characters into the main cast lives so that there will be more confusion & less laughter.

I am not sure if the director has actually read the script & realize where the show was going

At one point, I couldn't watch the show anymore & had to skip the complete episodes

I loved the Chandler character & Monika up to an extent

I hated Rachel, Phoebe & Ross characters, I know Ross character got PhD & he must have specialized in stupidity."

James Villaluz,5.0,"best american sitcom ever! it was all about the life of having and living with your friends together for 10 years through thick and thin. I t shows the importance of having trust and being open with your friends even in your difficult decision. When life pulls you down your friends are going to lift you up. Life is full of surprises and that was the greatest plot twist of this series.  I love Chandler being example of being dad, Monica as their mom who loves to cook, Joey for all the laughs and nasty acting skills, Phoebe being free spirit and jolly the time, Ross being the stubborn of the group and being great example of unexpected dad, and Rachel the spoiled bratt of the group on how she handle herself and being a grown up woman after years. I t was really great series I recommend you to watch this show."
Daniel Ferguson,4.0,"I still think that friends is a bit overrated, but it's one of the most uplifting things you will ever see. It's full of comedy especially from one Chandler Bing (my fav character).

The can laughter does drag it down a little bit for me, but it just wouldn't be friends if it didn't. It gives me a nice 'that's what i want to do when i'm older' vibe, a vibe that makes me all cozy. It's one of those shows that you sit down in your pj's and your tea or hot chocolate and just watch. It's also one that doesn't have an intense storyline to it so you can just sit and not pay loads of attention, you could be watching it whilst shopping online and still laughing at all the punchlines and be able to recap the whole episode after. Good Show."
Ashley Calderon,0.0,"Three words, eight letters. I Love You!!!!! This show is the funniest, sadest, most enjoyable and entertaining thing i have ever watched.

Unfortunately, it was removed from Netflix, but the won't stop it from being my favorite TV show ever. It has all the right components to make it  amazing, and it works well together!

Monica is an amazing chef, who likes neatness and control. She is super nice, funny, and just a little crazy. Also, a beautiful acting job by Courtney Cox. She and Chandler have 2 beautiful kids, twins! 

Rachel, played by the stunning Jennifer Aniston, is very fashion forward and a bit spoiled at the beginning. She and Ross embark on a rollercoaster of love and hate. She has a daughter, Emma, who is very sweet.

Phoebe is a loving, funny, and a tiny bit crazy masseuse. She loves playing guitar and is strictly vegetarian. (Except when she is pregnant) She had a hard childhood with her dad leaving and her mom committing suicide. She was on the street from the age of 14 and has a twin, Ursula. She lives with her grandmother, who makes delicious cookies. 

Chandler is sarcastic, funny, and nice. He and Monica pair up in London and have twins. His dad is gay and his mom is famous. Between having a chick and a duck and being a ""transponster"", he finds time to sit around and be a good friend. 

Ross is a nerdy, geeky guy desperately in love with Rachel. He has 2 kids, Ben and Emma, and 3 ex-wives. As a paleontologist, he is the smartest of the group. He is a great dad and a nice guy. Just don't take his sandwich!  

Joey, played by actor Matt LeBlanc, is a ladies man. With his famous catchphrase, "" How you doin'? "" He is funny, if a little dumb. He always put friendship first and is an amazing ada to hist chick and duck. 

Overall, there are

elizabeth bailey,5.0,This will always be my number one favorite show! Whenever I‚Äôm feeling sad or just had a bad day I can guarantee a laugh by putting this on! I have seen every single episode and know many of the lines by heart but I still crack up laughing every time. Chandler had always been my favorite character he is just hilarious and I was crushed to find out about his untimely death! Matthew Perry you were an amazing and talented actor and will always be missed!
Joelrey Ca√±al,0.0,"Way back 2016 I was reading a magazine and I saw Jennifer Aniston and I said WOW this lady is gorgeous.Well guess what that leads me to watching FRIENDS, I was so bored that time and I decided to search for series to watch though I'm really not a fan of watching series because for me it's like a waste of time. Anyway, I searched some files in my friends Hard Drive and try to look at FRIENDS , that was a good thing when Jennifer Aniston appeared at the Pilot Episode and so I decided to finish it. This show is the best, simply because anyone can relate to it. They are just making fun of each other, bullying each other , supporting each other and loving each other. There theme song says it well "" I'll be there for you "" because that is what true friendship do. Anyway, 2 nights ago I finished my 3rd time of watching FRIENDS, and here I am again watching Season 1 Episode 11 The One with Mrs. BING."
Elizabeth Sosa Ortiz [STUDENT],5.0,"Oh God, I love this show so much. You'll laugh so much . Especially when you get to the part where , ""We where on a break,"" and ""we were not""
They are all so perfect in their own little way. Chandler and his cute adorable little victory dance. Monica and her organizational skills. Ross and his scientific facts. Rachel and her drama as a fashionista. Joey and his goofy self which is so adorable. Last but no least Phoebe, she has a way of being funny and nice at the same time. I recommend this show to anyone and if you have doubts then you will regret having them because you  will absolutely love this show."
Crazy Girl,5.0,"The best show I've ever watched.Anybody would dream to have such friends,always with us,in ups and downs.The show focus on 6 friends in New York City,struggling to find career and love of their life.It has 10 seasons.

If you are gonna watch this,don't quit after 2 or 3 episodes. Watch upto 3 seasons and I am sure you'll get into the track.This is the friendship we all need.Friends who get us in trouble and take us away from it.Fighting for love to fighting for a couch,we laugh and cry with them.You can't watch the last episode without a tear. 

The chemistry between the actors add to the beauty of the show.Surrogacy,adoption,single parenting,homosexuality are portrayed in the show.Each character comes from different background and has different character.

If you feel down,watch this,you'll feel better.Do you think people all over the world would boast about a stupid show?No.That's it."
Mia Bowran,5.0,"Wow, just wow. The best show of all time!!! I started watching the series when I was 7. I stopped watching it for about a year but OMG, I fell in love with it when I was 8. I've watched it several times. My cousin gave me a big poster of the 6 characters drinking a milkshake and I was screaming. Phoebe has a sweet side, but at the same time a very fierce side. She's so funny. Ross is so kind, but can be really annoying. Like what Ross said, ""WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!"". Rachael's sense of style is so good. She taught us that you can look great in anything, even if it means pjs. Monica is a super cleaning freak, but she is so kind. She is always there for her friends. Like Rachael, she has a great sense of style, but her style is more casual. Joey is so funny and so gullible!! He is a grown man and doesn't understand that women don't have Adam's applesüòÇ he is so nice tho. Always there for others. But my favourite is Chandler, or should I say, ""Miss Chanlender Bong"". He is smart (but not all the time. He is sarcastic. And he is one of the most sweetest characters on the show. This tv series is so worth watching."
sanghsheel gautam,5.0,"Hi....I am from India.
There can't be any substitute for this sitcom. 
All time favourite. It was started in the year I was born,1994. I love all six of them. Joey,pheebs,rachel,monica,ross and last but not the least The chandler. I have alreary watched it alot of time and can watch it for rest of my life. This is something can not be off the table.  
I feel pitty for the people who don't watch it or haven't watched it yet cuz they are missing most precious thing in their lives. 
Love Monica's 'I know'
Love Ross 'we were on a break'
Love pheebs 'smelly cat'
Joey's 'How you doin'
Rachel's 'its a metaphor daddy'
And The Chandler's sense of humour is the best...can't give credit to only single thing of him when he had best dialogues. I love Chandler alot. Every girl needs a Chandler in her life. 
Love to all."
Sabrina Wakley,0.0,This show is my Moms very favorite show that she loves to watch for comfort. I watched it as I got older and I feel like that is our most watched show. I love the gang. Rachel is my favorite gal along with Phoebe because they seem to act the goofiest. I love Chandler and Joey as a team and Ross is great with his dinosaurs. These are what real friends should be and I have always dreamed of having them. I do love Monica even if she is a clean freak. This cast was the best and no one could replace them. Plus at least I know they always cared for each other on and off set.
Vikram Singh,0.0,"Finally Ross and Rachel is Each Other's Lobsters. As Jennifer said In an Interview Ross and Rachel must be Remarried and have more Childrens and living their life Happily.

I am 13 years old so I understand most of the jokes and haven't seen alot of r rated or other type of shows, but after watching a few episodes 8 weeks ago I fell in love with it. Just watching this show gives you a warm feeling and once you get to know the characters you will be rooting for them the whole way. I am now on the last episode of season 9 sad that in about two weeks I will be looking for another show to spend my time onüò¢"
RABIN R,5.0,One of the greatest shows of all time üôå. Friends is truly a heart warming show. It revolves around some good people they all stick together with there ups and downs. Every episode is just awesome and the all the show's are so great the 6 cast members with there back story of the lives living in New York and enjoying their times with each other is so incredibly awesome. This is the best show all time. These show will not be forgotten by anyone u watching it. And the awesome thing is that it's coming back in 2020 on HBO max. With the same cast. So excellence for it.  Love the friends ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Santosh Sarikar,5.0,"I don't know why all audience reactions are same, are they just copying.....Anyway let me share with you how exactly i started to watch this sitcom. I had 512 MB ram Samsung mobile, so u can understand storage capacity. I got one season somewhere i think at one of my friend. I started to watch it. Initially i did  not get that excited but at the ending of first season i just couldn't believe how best sitcom i would have missed if I didn't have pendrive.  After that I literally struggled to get remaining seasons. I finished all ten seasons in three or four seatings. I have never enjoyed or realized how humor can be so  effective if you are struggling with your life. Even i would say this sitcom not only helped me in my depression period but made me realise how friendship is so important in our life. I have seen friends almost for five times. I can now tell all the dialogues with every scenes and situations if anyone would ask. Till 5th season Ross and Joe were my favorite characters but later on i realise if anyone made that show best show then it's Chandler. I still get emotional when all  characters put their keys on table . The end of an era. I think FRIENDS is one of the best sitcom ever produced and directed by Chuck lorre."
Violet LeFey,0.0,"I also think this is one of the greatest TV shows of all time.  Admittedly, I'm a GenX-er, and I'll tell ya - this show WAS my life.  At that age, it was nothing but friends, fun and some Friends.  And I think its aged very well - there's only one episode that dates it slightly but it cracks me up (""The one where Ross finds out"") where Rachel has to borrow a cell phone from a dude in a restaurant.  (ah, yes, when not everybody's face was down on their damn phones...good times!).

I think it truly was the LAST great sitcom.  

And I think I'm with everybody else.  B/c it was the last great one, where everybody became so ""involved"" with the characters...its like, I NEED TO KNOW Ross & Rachel are still together!  I NEED to know Monica & Chandler are too.  I NEED to know Phoebe is the soccer mom and got her 5 kids, Volvo and lovely house in Connecticut.  And Joey is a world famous actor.  Dammit, please do at least a Xmas special, or New Years special, lol!  
Anyway - that's my review.  If you've never seen...watch.  Its just good brain & heart candy.  
Peace!"
Mariyum khan,5.0,This the best show in the entire world and not even exaggerating like this show is the best thing that I've ever watched. Watching if for so long made me feel like i was a part of it and im not kidding i watched it like five times and i haven't gotten bored of it and if you know me you would know that i get bored of stuff very easily and this is the first thing in the world that i haven't gotten bored of. In these hard times of corona virus we all just need something to escape from this sad reality so if you want to do that watch this amazing show. It will make you happier than ever. Love this show.
Allan Binoy,5.0,"Its just the absolute best!! No other words to describe this beauty series .If u want to feel absolutely and purely happy just watch this show ,I promise u its worth it and more than what it actually is. I actually found  F.R.I.E.N.D.S. when I was passing through random tv channels and the first thing i saw was phoebes face and the last episode and it made me more than happy ,it made me complete and content!! This is not just a sitcom to me, this TV show changed my life .I am so grateful to everyone in the cast and show for this wonderful sitcom!!

If I am a doctor and a depressed patient came to me, only thing I would treat him with is a combined DVD of  F.R.I.E.N.D.S"
Pragya Dhungana,5.0,"Friends is not just a sitcom, it‚Äôs an emotion. Everything about this show is so perfect. This show is not only hilarious but emotional and relaxed at the same time. It taught me that we all have problems in our life but with right people by our side, everything will be fine. I also learned that ‚ÄúReal world sucks, but we all will eventually love it.‚Äù If you are going through bad breakup or want to get out of depression, this show will do the magic. Give it a try, and you will thank yourself. Solid 10/10"
Praveen Suryawanshi,5.0,"'Friends' goes down as one of the best web series ever made and the best sitcom ever. Now some may say I'm bragging until they see it by themselves. As one can't pick holes in any of direction, writing, acting, music, screenplay etc.etc. Talking of the 'friends' it's an American sitcom comprising ten seasons aired between 1994 to 2004. It depicts story of six youngsters three of them are boys and the rest are girls accompanied by a herd. Who hang out together, eat and drink, go on vacations and do much other stuff too.
   I'll tell you about everyone of them succinctly, starting with lady characters. First comes fashioninsta, confident, and candid Rachel played by Jennifer Aniston. She's all about enjoying herself and not letting other's thoughts screw her up. For me she's more of a G.f. material. Then comes Monica played by Courtney Cox, a germaphobe, chafe, hospitable and a termagant sometimes. She's undoubtedly the closest to a marriage material woman. Phoebe, third and last female character and the most peculiar one played by Lisa Kudrow. She's an outlandish, off-beat, kinky blonde woman with great sense of humour. Her loyalty and promptness to help others makes her a very heart of clique.
   Now I shall tell you about the boys and that's where I get bemused with who's my the most favourite character? Is he a sarcastic, hopeless and awkward and desperate Chandler or handsome and innocent Joey? Well I can't tell. See I like Chandler as he's the funniest and no can be at zenith of sarcasm as he does. I like Joey too as I'm also an epicurean and who else got the better fall for it line as he does. However while moving to the last character my confusion rises to the peak, as I introduce to you, Ross a.k.a 'The Divorce force'. An undisputed king of expressions and timing. A paleontologist who's a pundit of 'Unagi' and literally a blend of all other characters. I think I'm done with my introduction theory and I just hope every group has these type of 'namunas'. So finally, it's time to wind up my humdrum monograph if it's not and say goodbye. Here I drops the mic."
Lia SA,5.0,"I love this show so much. I never got to see it when it aired but my husband bought me the series in 2005 after it ended. The series is so much better because it has a lot of missing scenes that are not aired. 
       It takes you on four different journeys. One of a beautiful, strong, and enduring relationship you should have seen coming. Then another relationship with so many ups and downs you're not even sure they should be together. 
      A story of growing up, learning to date, working at whatever you have to to pay your bills, and having it possibly work out. 
     Finally a crazy adventure of finding a family in the most unexpected places. The things families do for each other. And the many obstacles and relationships you have to go through to make a family of your own and find your lobster. 
    I think what makes it great is you can see yourself in any one of these stories.
   It's one of those shows you can see over and over again. I have seen it almost every day since 2005. ü§™ I've had so many surgeries and medical procedures done and FRIENDS is always my go-to. They always make me feel better. ü´∂üèº"
Noluthando Nyandu,5.0,"10/10. An EXTRA ORDINARY show. I'm 25 years old by the way, which means when the show first premiered, I wasn't even conceived yet! However, I fell in love with it so much. I saw reels and skits on social media which made laugh so hard, I knew I had to watch full episodes and I am proud to say, I finished all seasons in less than a week, yes, all 10 seasons in less than a week. I just couldn't shut down my laptop. It made me laugh & cry, big up to the creators, writers, actors/actress and crew of the show. Amazing work. Best show ever written and created. Much love from South Africa"
Darin Thomas,5.0,"Friends is the best sitcom show in history.
It teaches us a lot about friendship,love , making mistakes is alright and a lot more.
The main six characters were not actors but people living in the show.Everyone needs to watch this show Atleast once. It gives us moments to think about , to laugh out loud,and heart touching moments which bring out Atleast a single tear.
I am so grateful for this show and I could never say enough and I don't know what to say to make you understand how great and wonderful this show is
Friends is no longer a show to me it's an EMOTION."
Avi Nash,5.0,"The best show you can ever see!!!!
The actors have lived every moment of their characters... 
I watched the series within 20 days and it has been fabulous!! Every character has their own uniqueness . Now I finished the series, i felt the really bad it is over. The last season must have got everyone's feelings to a high level. After finishing all moments come to my mind, especially Phoebe's marriage was so stunning that I now feel how the scene was filled with joy... The ending too was great .
If the series continues, we would be delighted to see it ... Definitely gonna be missing a great series."
Yolo Solo Solo,5.0,One of the best shows of all time! I am the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt really say something is the best or give it 10/10 but friends is honestly one of the greatest shows of all time. People may disagree which is completely acceptable because it‚Äôs their opinion but the show has all the emotions and is not only entertaining but also inspiring. Whenever I feel down I just open Netflix and watch friends. I love that show and the actors because  they have done a wonderful job with their characters. The story line is absolutely amazing and my favourite show of all time. Definitely recommend it for every single person out there!
Lohan Asmika,5.0,"This is one of the best tv Series I've ever watched. It is so life touching and  funny. It has brilliant writing and an incredibly talented cast. personally my favourite characters were Joey & Rachel. I was like so obsessed with the series it was so cool. I like the way everything works out and the closeness they have as friends. When I'm watching this I always thought that the cast members are really best friends like in the story. This movie is so close to me because, when I'm like depressed or sad I would just watch an episode and it would cheer me up all the time. I love this story. I wish it never ended."

Diptanshu goswami,5.0,"Indeed One of the Greatest sitcom!
It was the most relatable sitcom,The 90s era was beautifully captured and on top of that as a sitcom it was funny as hell,It had the greatest ensemble of cameos ever in tv, The intro was catchy,It had most unique situations with the different kind of charcters and great actors, each character was on the league of their own, Monica like elder to all,rachel's like rich room-mate,ross was all nerd/brains,joey with little dumb and much fun,chandler as a sarcastic one and the unique of them all phoebe, individually they are awesome characters and the chemistry between the 6 was undescribable. The jaince was the most amazing fun/hateble character ever in sitcom,every apperance of her was a surprise, gunther and everyone's family members was good as side charcters and mike at last 2 season blends well with the 6, the story with all the plots ranging from starting to end of show and in between were brilliantly written, although the flasback sequence episodes were dull, the plot of ross and rachel was roller-coaster, and the last season really pulled a perfection it was the most satisfying end of the show."

I have seen many TV shows but this has really something with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I mean not that all the jokes were funny (many were predictable) but it's not only about comedy.

Amazing show from amazing cast, mind blowing work form mind blowing cast and crew. Every season ending has an amazing twist. people who give less than 5 stars u guys suck."
Sachin Verlekar,5.0,"F R.I.E.N.D.S will be a forever History making TV show and a sitcom which was aired on American Television channel NBC for the first time. It is one of the best TV sitcom you will ever see. The daily struggles they all deal with supporting each other in their story is a kind of a real world scenario combined slightly with fun and frolic. It's a very addictive TV show i must say!
FRIENDS is a nostalgic TV series which has touched millions of hearts in the world and will do the same for every generations incessantly!
Do watch it online ....or Comedy Central channel!"
Poppy L,5.0,Best show ever!!!! In secondry school it helpped me in soooooo many ways! If it wasn't for Joey and Phoebe I wouldn't have been the same way now. I did definitely recommend this show! I know fully know most of Phoebe's songs and even know how to spell her name of by heart! I have made friends over thus show and also say most of there quotes in real life! I mainly say who of my friend group is which character. The way they set the program out is soooo cool and I love all of the actors/ actresses and feel like I can relate to all of the characters!!
Jailin Matias-Rivera,0.0,"friends is by far the best most funny and most feeling involved show I've ever watched! I've seen every season 3 times and I'm almost finished with my 4th round. thank you for comforting me all these years.
I'm only 12 turning 13 soon and my mom was watching it one day and i just sat down next to her to watch it. next thing i know I'm on Netflix searching for it, and when i finally found it i was HOOKED. it is my favorite show of all time i even like it better than spongebob and coming from me thats saying a lot. my favorite character s Chandler Bing. he is just so sarcastic just like me!! so basically I'm growing up watching friends just like the rest of family!!"
DISHA TODANI,5.0,"For me friends is literally like a therapy.... I assure that you will just re watch this show again and again coz it's so damn good.....it makes you realise that sometimes friends are there for you even when your family is against you...it shows that even broken friendships and relationships can be fixed with the right efforts... seriously this series was with me when no one else...you can actually watch this if you are sad , happy, bored, excited, in tension or literally anytime... seriously if you ever feel alone this series can be your best companion....90s time was really good üôå
The time when any character in the series dies in real life it always feels like a personal loss so you can well imagine how good this actually is üôÇ"
Vaiebhav Patil,5.0,"Best show ever!
You will get hooked right from Season 1, you will fall in love with the characters, their storyline, everything. They will become your best friends, let me tell you one thing, once you start watching the show, you get into a never ending loop of watching friends, their is no stopping- you finish s10, u take a break, u start all over gain, coz its just teriibly difficult to get over that ending, the characters who aged with you, who you have grown to love, if you haven't watched it yet just go watch it, I swear it will be worth every minute and you will be howling with laughter in every epsiode, there will be episodes which will make you cry too, overtime till you reach season 10, you will fall in love with the show, characters, everything about F.R.E.N.D.S and then their is no turning back."

This show is about six friends and there lives living in Manhattan and working through their lives. This show have everything and the direction is most beautiful.
The last episode was aired in 2004 which is 16 years ago but I don't think there will be any show that can match the simplicity and humor of this show.
I have watched every episode more than ten times and can watch 10 times more without getting bored. I highly recommend that everyone should see this."
Wraith Watchful,5.0,"I only watched this show in my later years whenever they put it on Netflix. I thought that the show was absolutely wonderful !

My experience before with David Arquette and Courtney Cox was along the lines of Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Scream. Seeing them in this show was really cool & refreshing. Lisa Kudrow's type of humor was something that had to grow on me because I didn't like her character at first. I do now :) David Schwimmer was pretty cute on the show, and pulled off an intense and sort of nerdy PhD that worked in a museum with dinosaurs. Jennifer Aniston always seemed to be showing her.. highbeams.. through every single shirt that she wore on every single episode that she was in. Her acting is excellent, however, and in my opinion didn't need to be so obviously oversexed. 

Chandler was probably my favorite because he was so awkward but extremely funny. :) I loved the depth of his character & also whenever he and Monica finally got together :)

Katherine L,5.0,"The best sitcome of all time. I for one loved all the characters and felt relatable to each one of them. My favorite is definitely Joey. He was the perfect friend and proved this time and again, whether it was offering to marry Phoebe when he thought she was pregnant or giving up a girl for his best bud Chandler or even peeing on Monica. I just wish he would have ended up with someone before the season finale."
Chandler Bing,5.0,"This show wasn't just a show it was life ...Now also it is one of best show ever ... Really this show made me cry and smile at the same time...I don't think I will ever forget this show , they weren't friends they were family ..that taught us many things than our real friends ,This is actually a blockbuster show of all time with 6 iconic characters... sarcastic like Chandler, clean like Monica , care like Rachel,geek like Ross , eat like Joey , live like Phoebe.....these are unforgettable characters ...I really wanna say thanks to the directors and writers of friends for creating such a amazing show and also actors for portraying it fabulously ....I gonna love this show and characters forever... friendship and love should be like friends .... fantastic 10 years ..till now also indescribable experience ....not only love it but live like this showüòçüòò"
Bhumika Nayak,5.0,"This is an iconic show. You must watch it at least once just to understand the references thrown in other shows about this show üòÇüòÇ
What can i say about this show that's not been said before? It's heartwarming, perfect, lovable blah blah blah. But for me... It feels like home ‚ù§ it's like a giant hug! Because I've watched it too many times to count.. Every time I watch it, it gives me comfort that nothing is wrong with the world! üòá
Joey, Rachel, Monica, Ross, Chandler and Phoebe are friendship goals in every way imaginable. 
It's a sitcom... Not THE best sitcom out there but definitely iconic. And its worthy of a watch... You won't regret it

10 seasons, 236 episodes... But what a classic üíñüëè
Rating: 7.5/10
Genre: comedy."
Charlotte Rose,5.0,"I‚Äôve binged watched this show millions of times and I would definitely recommend it to a friends, although most of them already doüòÇ. 

Currently watching it at the moment lol, 7th or 8th time I‚Äôm pretty sure.

The only tweak I would make is that MONICA AND CHANDLER GOT TOGETHER SOONER, like oh‚Ä¶my‚Ä¶god they are the best couple ever hands down. Aswell, they were definitely soulmates from the start, even when Monica was with Richard and Chandler was with Janice you could tell they were in love."
Sagrika Paliwal,5.0,"FRIENDS is the best thing that happened to me in 2020.
I started watching it during the lockdown and it ended up becoming my most favourite show ever. The show is so much positive and it will make you laugh endlessly. The cast is so perfect that you won't be able to imagine them going out of character. Especially, Matt Le Blanc as JOEY!!!
The character is so damn adorable, hot and fun, that you will end up falling in love with him. Now I know why people are so mad about this show!"
Rimi Sarkar,5.0,"Best show ever... Everyone should watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S.  Helps you to survive through depression... Make you laugh even when you don't feel like it... Something you will watch over and over again and still won't get bored... Just give it a try everyone and you will fall in love with every individual character and the show‚ù§‚ù§thanks to my friend who recommended me to watch the show and even gave me the whole 10 seasons... At first I was like what is the craze about this show and I wasn't even sure if I'll complete watching 10 seasons...but damn !! after completing season 1, I just got addicted and I never stopped until I was done with all the seasons... Now it's my 4th time watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. ‚ù§"
Kshitij Kumar Rai,5.0,"Best comic tv series I have ever watched on TV. Great performance from all the actors and memorable characters like Chandler Bing, Monica, Rachel, Ross, Phoebe and Joey. Every time I watch it makes me laugh on almost every scenes and so I can watch all seasons back to back without getting bored. Love it. Thanks to creators for making such a lovable show. It will be there forever in my life."
Andrew Starliper,5.0,"I‚Äôm on my second run through friends. One of the best shows I have ever watched. I feel that people that discredit never gave it a chance, or just feel they shouldn‚Äôt like it just because it‚Äôs a good show. I love the characters, and how they kept us longing for Ross and Rachael to finally figure it out. However my only complaint is that season 10 kinda felt rushed, and could have had better send offs. And the fact that the spinoff took Joey to L.A. when he was clearly all about his friends who still all lived in New York at the time. I feel like the show can pick back up one day, but that‚Äôs just a hope for me!"
rahul rajpurohit,0.0,"If you are having a bad day, go watch any episode of The Most Hilarious sitcom.Once you start watching it you won't stop.It grows on you ..
It's filled to the brim with awesome punch lines, awesome sarcasm, oh my gawd(spoiler alert!!) It has the most amazing sarcastic lines.It has also got Cliff hanger moments which leaves your brain full of million thoughts and craving...
Watching FRIENDS will make friends with these eccentric six persons ,and make you wanna hang out in central perk all the time and they will be there for you, true story!"
Achutam Jha,5.0,"Friends takes a lot of time- about thirty episodes- to really get going and it's only then that the humor starts to really work- and it's a real treat. But the attractive cast in their impeccable outfits keep you going for those thirty episodes. 
The characters are very well-written and make the show worth watching more than anything else and when such a familiarity is built with them, it helps create some truly iconic moments (both comedic and dramatic) that stay with you forever and make you realise precisely why the show continues to be such a big hit in a world plagued by one crisis after another."
Hyacinth Ashley Flores,5.0,"BEST SITCOM EVER!!!! I started watching this when I was in Senior High School‚Äîwith all the anxiety of college and the future itself, the academic stresses and all the teenage madness, but somehow I was always laughing and that's because of FRIENDS. It's incredibly relatable and feels comfortable to watch anytime. It's beautifull, funny and romantic. It's strange but it feels home in 10 seasons. It is perfectly casted, well-written and totally remarkable. The cast is iconic and they crafted such a phenomenal series. Kudos to the producers, the cast and all who made the show such a perfect and timeless sitcom. It's my comfort series, and I'll never not watch it. Definitely the best show of all time!!! Also, I love Joey! <3"
Sourin Saha,0.0,"This is not just a show because it may have finished but not even a single person would be able to deny the fact that re-watching countless times each and every episode is no less than watching them the first time. It was a way of life and the best part was it was so normal and about common things. Friends, you made me understand so many truths of life. Always grateful for such a gift... Even after all these years and so many other shows, it is still the best and will always be"
Sabine Alessandra,5.0,"Best Sitcom Ever
It is an incredible story of 6 friends going through life in New York. It is the best 10 seasons I have ever watched.

HOME,5.0,"This television series is not just a show, but it means happiness to me. This series makes me happy and feel good. Like the story line, well arranged and great scripted. It is impossible to choose one chapter but my favourite is Joe. Monica would be my second favourite because she is so simple and nice. Chandler is the funniest character  I have ever seen on television. Phebe is loveable weirdo. Rachel is beautiful and Ross will always be the dinosaur guy. No doubt whole world love them so do I."
Shivangi Agarwal,5.0,"Friends is the ultimate feel-good show! It‚Äôs timeless, with a perfect balance of humor, heart, and unforgettable moments. Every character‚ÄîRoss, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe‚Äîbrings something unique, making you feel like you're part of their close-knit group. Whether it‚Äôs the iconic one-liners or the hilarious everyday situations, it‚Äôs a show you can watch again and again. No matter what mood I‚Äôm in, Friends always lifts my spirits. It‚Äôs truly a classic that never gets old!"
Madilyn Schroeder,0.0,"This show most definitely needs to do a reunited season of Ross, Joey, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe with like a shoot to the future of what they are doing now. Since all of them are still alive I feel like it would make the show that much interesting. I have seen this show about 39 times and in about a month I will be back at it again watching it again because I love it just that much. At some point in my life I would love to meet everyone of the cast of friends. 

If you agree with me that the show should do a reunited season like this maybe they will see it and consider it."
Lok Pradeep Raghavan,5.0,"BEST SITCOM EVER!!!!
If you are into sitcoms...friends is a classic and a must watch
the sitcom is about how 6 friends go about in their separate lives as well as together.
and trust me the stories that this sitcom are very exciting
if u dont believe when people say friends is truly the greatest sitcom ever
google ross geller and click on that sofa icon on the right side of his name
its so good that google gave a little something to contribute to its 25th anniversary
anyways once you like it, you cannot get enough of this series"
Amisha Singh,5.0,"This tv show is the best thing I have ever watched... u will never get bored of binge watching it again and again.... I still enjoy the jokes and comedy scenes, even though I have memorised most of the epic dialogues.... the perfect casting with a perfect plot is the best thing about it... each of the 6 characters portrayed are truly amazing... even though the end is heartbreaking, and you don‚Äôt want it to end, their can‚Äôt be any other justifiable end... selecting the favourites is the most difficult thing because u can find many things in common with each character of the show... Their is a separate fan base for f.r.i.e.n.d.s and I could say... the world can be easily divided into 2 parts- those who have watched friends and those who have not... I pity for the other part of the worldüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Julieta ceniza,5.0,"Watched on the year 2021 not reading a single review until I finished 10 seasons and it was the best sitcom ever. This just changed my whole life. I was shocked knowing I wasn't even born yet when they started filming the first season. I'm already 24 years old now and I totally TOTALLY relate to every episode on every season. I JUST LOVED IT. I missed a lot of sleep because of this show but who cares HAHAHA. I will totally rewatch all seasons for like 1,2,3 oh Hell I will rewatch it everytime I want to."
Isadora C.B. Steinberg,5.0,"Oh... My... God! ""Chandler Bing!"" (just ignore that last part if you haven't watched FRIENDS, wich a cannot believe you didn't). This is the best sitcom/series/whatever ever made! MY FAVORITE SERIES OF ALL TIMES! WATCH IT, IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!! But, really, this series it's sooooooo funny, with some romance, a great plot and cast. And, though every single episode gives you a new funny story, it has also a continue plot, that develops during the seasons. 
If anyone ever told you that is too long, I think it is not and it could have until 100 seasons, but I'm also fine with ""just"" 10. If you're looking for something to watch, FRIENDS is the answer."
Sreevarshan S,5.0,"I didn't have a happy school and college days in which the people with me in school and college are not in my life. In which I didn't have a good circle of good friends. This series F.R.I.E.N.D.S thought some valuable lessons from each character Chandler ,Monica ,Ross ,Rachel ,Joey ,Phoebe. I imagine them as if they are around me in each and every moment of life spreading love and joy to me. Seriously I didn't believe that it was made during the late 90's .it fits perfectly into people's lifes in each and every generation. 

These Stars have given their best for their character. They may became older now but their characters will speak for each and every generations .

I just love all the characters

With love

Anonymous,5.0,best web series I have ever seen...!! although it is a comedy show but it also have some emotional moments... it also teach us being on your own.. value of friendship and more... I'm not satisfied with ending of this show it should've some more season or any movies with same characters... anyways it was my first webseries and i really enjoyed it a lot... i was watching like 10-20 episodes per dayüòÖ its best to watch during lockdown and it will surely make you laugh üòÖ
Ikram Maizi,4.0,"This show is so so funny, I can't stop laughing no matter how many time i watch it, but i won't give it 5 stars because of some inappropriate jokes about women, body shaming and making fun of other cultures.. i love all the characters they all have their flaws but generally they are good friends and very funny! Especially joey and Phoebe.. the casting is awesome they really owned their roles.. the script writing is genius except for the inappropriate things i mentioned.. finally i don't think the show is overrated i think it deserves all the fame it got i've watched many other comedy shows, but friends is always so special!"
Samridhya Moitra,2.0,"When I was a college kid I really enjoyed it, but once I grew older and got introduced to better shows and cinema, I realized how cringey and heavily flawed FRIENDS was. Every episode is just predicated on one of the characters getting a new bf or a gf. Romance, dating are the driving forces. Once you watch shows like Seinfeld (by the way FRIENDS is heavily influenced from it; but not many people know; as Seinfeld himself went on to comment that FRIENDS just copied from his show, replacing the cast with a better looking one), Schiitt's Creek, The Office, even TBBT (Initial few seasons) you realize what a good sitcom can be.

The characters have no arc of development apart from Chandler. Most of the performances seem over-dramatic especially Monica, Rachel and Ross. Perry is the only decent performer, simply cause maybe he was playing his real sarcastic self. Aniston as Rachel is just downright annoying and so is Cortney Cox as Monica. Barring a few good episodes, I don't feel it has much to offer."
Diamond Sparkle343,5.0,"A series which shows the adventures of 6 friends (Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and Phoebe Buffay).

Olabisi Olaoye,0.0,"I absolutely LOVE Friends! It's my favorite series ever, hands down. I just love that all six main characters have such chemistry among one another. I can't stop watching Friends over and over again because it's just so funny! It really does lift your spirits when you see these six wonderful people; but my favorite is definitely Phoebe. Definitely the weirdest, wackiest, most interesting girl in the show. I love them all, though."
Shwe Yati Phyo,5.0,"It's no secret why Friends is a legendary sitcom. Though it was made in the 90's and early 2000's, it's still so popular to this day. I just love it so much. It's hilarious and the jokes just crack me up whenever I watch it. The six friends are quite different, but they all make me laugh so hard. I have to admit, the first season wasn't my favorite as I found it a bit boring. This was because I haven't really gotten the flow of the show and didn't know the characters very well, and the actors themselves don't know their characters as much. But by the second and third seasons, the show was just brilliant. One thing I find the most fascinating about this show is how rewatchable it is. You can rewatch it a hundred times and the jokes still crack you up over and over again. I totally recommend this show to someone who's looking for a great sitcom to watch."
maanya chaudhary,5.0,Tbh i LOVED this TV show... Its soooo comforting and fun to watch... U must watch this show Its rlly cool... Ik Its kinda old but i bet u'd still love it... The ending is rlly sad as the show will end and u'll just be so used to it and wont be able to get over the fact tht the show ended... U may also be able to relate to the show a lil as the show is based on the daily lives of all the friends...I loved it sm tht im watching it again lol... So i totally recommend and u must go for it w/o any further adado.

HABD,5.0,"I have watched this for the nth time! And every time I watch it, it's a familiar story but it still feels like watching it the first time! I always laugh as if I didn't laugh at that scene before!! And as soon as I finished all seasons I missed it right away that I immediately watch the first episode again, it's a wonderful cycle that I never want to stop! I love them all. This is the only show that I love all the characters! Kudos to everyone who works so hard in this show. BEST SHOW ever! Thank you to all the staff and stars of this show for making this a great one!"
Nitin Chandran,5.0,"This is very spl show to me. I have watched few episodes of it in bits & pieces during my childhood.. nvr was so crazy abt american sitcoms back then. But currently i m warching whole its episodes from the start.. in Netflix.. i am spending 4-5 hours in a stretch regularly.. chandler and joey are my most loved characters in this sitcom. Many of us wish a reunion of friends series again.. but personally i dont wish so. I cant see an aged joey, rachel, ross .. at this age playing friends.. i may not enjoy that as much as i enjoy the young and youthful friends. Instead i wud prefer watching whole episode once again, to bring back my childhood memories... Kudos to the entire crew for making such a wonderful sitcoms ever.. and making our childhood feel so special... thanks a lot"
Kottieshwari Srinivasan,0.0,"F. R. I. E. N. D. S
I wonder how they came up with such a beautiful story.  First of all F. R. I. E. N. D. S is the best ever one could watch when they are happy or sad or depressed or just like that. 

The characters - Ross, Rachael, Joey, Phoebe, Monica and Chandler. They just show you how the actual friends be. 

Ross's intelligent and nerd thing, Rachel's dramatic sense, Joe's childish behaviour, Phoebe's weirdness, Monica's discipline and finally Chandler's sarcastic jokes, I bet this series ruled the 90's and it still rock today and it will in coming years. 

You can't find a mistake or anything here. It's just a life of 6 friends with stick around together in all good and bad. 

It has a simple story line with intense touch. I bet most people might have cried during the final episodes. Even I did. 

F. R. I. E. N. D. S is the perfectionist of all other series. It just make you laugh and laugh and laugh. 

Friends fans will remember Central Perk forever. One can not find a favourite character instead the characters becomes your favourite. I just love it. 

You can watch it like 'n' times and one cannot get tired of it. F. R. I. E. N. D. S has so much memories, love, fun, pain, happiness. It's not F. R. I. E. N. D. S, it's FAMILY ‚ô•"

Guess what? I dont have to explain you about how awesome is this show ........ Coz there always be one person among your group, who has forced or forcing you or "" suggesting"" you this show already. So that way u know , how this show has left its mark on television history. I mean , it was aired 1995 and its 2021 now!!! And stilk can't stop talking about it .

All the six main actors brought out their best to make their characters perfect. This show is for the people who believe in friendship and love comedy. It's a show you can watch over and over again and still enjoy the show. You can relate to some qualities form each character and learn a few life lessons. Even being a kid from 21st century i can relate to the characters. Overall a perfect package of laughter. üíØ"
S C,0.0,"I‚Äôm watching FRIENDS all the time, I‚Äôve seen every season like 6 times so far and I keep on watching. They NEVER grow old! These great actors will maybe never understand how much they meant back then for so many generations of young people, of young actors, how much they inspired and opened closed minds... how much they mean to the day. I love them so much and also followed them through the years, whatever they were doing. I‚Äôm so in love with them. I dream and phantasize all the time about a ‚Äúnext‚Äù season: FRIENDS coming back! Where we can see where they‚Äôre at after 20+ years with their stories and families. They are even sexier now in their 50z, then ever. I won‚Äôt lose hope!"
tyler stueck,0.0,"I love this show with my entire life. I started watching it 2 years ago when I was finding a new show. I've seen it in the past on cable television but I didn't start binge watching it until 2017. I was feeling really sad for no reason, and when I started watching the show my entire life changed. I received a new perspective on life and the entire show just puts me in a good mood. I watch it every night, and I am currently rewatching (again) starting Season 1 for the 11th time about last week. It's an amazing sitcom and I think anyone who needs to be put in a good mood at any time, or anyone that needs a good laugh should watch this show. 10/10. <3"
Lily Williams,0.0,"this show is so amazing!!! ive re watched it 3 times, and it never gets old!! my favorite show of all time! and the cast is so gorgeous !! (especially the guys) it includes the best friend group of ALL time, and has plot twists and cliff hangers that you wouldn't believe! I LOVE THIS SHOW WITH ALL OF MY HEART!! THE ROMANCE TOO UGHHH!<3 MONICA, RACHEL, PHOEBE, JOEY, ROSS AND ESPECIALLY CHANDLER I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH!!"
Hansaniee Kora,5.0,"Best sitcom ever. My go to when I‚Äôm feeling down. Grew up with it and love that I don‚Äôt have to wait ages for an episode now, just stream it or always on in one channel or the other. 
Learnt about American culture, improved my English and wanted to live like them when I grew up lol. Definitely Lots of offensive stuff in it so just watch it for the comedic value."
Katherine Newtown,5.0,Friends is the best show on the planet! I first started watching at the age of 10 and couldn't ever stop! Friends is a hilarious sitcom that will for sure put you in a good mood whenever you are blue! It has an amazing cast that will make you pee your pants with laughter! I love Friends and if you haven't yet seen please turn on your T.V now and start watching!
Kasozi Johnkeith,5.0,"Honestly , this is a work of art...it was probably  produced when I was like  so young...21 years later..I get to watch it.. it's something  so rich in talent and knowledge.  
It has the authenticity of a sitcom show.
 With actors fitting in so well in the  series. 
 It's a classic.. And I want to thank all those who made it possible  for this series to actually  come to life..     incase your reading my review without  watching  it, your surely missing  it."
fourhead,5.0,"friends is a tv shows i really love because this show showed,explained a lot of things to me. for while i was depressed,stressed about a lot but when i watched friends inside of me got that feeling that when you laughed so hard you didnt wanted it to stop. i really want to have those kind friends like monica,chandler,joey,rachel and ross. those actors who played them should get more than they got even though they got a lot but still those actors didnt act they lived,they lived by playing those roles."
Prajwal Pradhan,5.0,"This show aired in 1994 and I started watching it from 2018. I had heard about it but never bothered to watch. After I started watching the show I realised what I had been missing. 

The best thing about this show is no matter how many times you watch it you will laugh as hard as you did the first time. People think that it is overrated but the thing is that they haven't watched it and just can't stand it's popularity. This show made me laugh, cry and fall in love with it's characters.

Ross- Ross is a divorced guy whose ex wife is a lesbian. I think he is the most underrated character because his acting is so great. His relationship with Joey, Phoebe and the other three is really great. He works in a museum and he loves dinosaurs.

Chandler- THE KING OF SARCASM! ü§£ü§£  Chandler is a normal working guy with Joey as his roommate. His comic timing and sense of humour is so awesome. His relationship with Joey is also great. 

Monica- She is Ross's sister. She is always very organised and clean and she is beautiful. 

Phoebe - My fav character and weirdest in the gang. She is a vegan and also believes in some superstitious stuffs. I love her relationship with Joey, their conversations are always so weirdüòÑ. Her back story is also so weird and when she is losing an arguement she uses her mother's suicide as a sheild. She has a twin sister Ursula and they two hate each other. Phoebe believes her grandfather is Albert Einstein (as it is told by her grandmother). 

Joey- Foody, Childish, dumb are the words to describe Joey Tribbiani. His relationship with his friends is so great, he loves them immensely and to him his friends are his world. He is a struggling actor and dates many girls.

Rachel- when the show starts she is potrayed as a spoiled daughter of a rich man but as the show progresses she starts realising the importance of self reliance. She is beautiful, sexy and her relationship with her friends is great. 

Honorable mentions
Gunther- Gunther works at Central Perk ( where the six of them hang out). He is in love with Rachel and he hates Ross."
Manesa Modhgil,5.0,"Honestly the best show to exist. Lightens up your mood. I could rewatch it n still find it funny. There r other shows that have worse characters n attitudes n what not. Yet people accept those?! How the character is portrayed is totally the character, there is no need to judge it in so detail. Loosen up a lil n just watch when u have a meal or something. Trust me, it would lighten up your mood! It did for me! Im kind of sad why are there no other shows made like this anymore, watched others good n all but friends has its own spot. You could watch that 70‚Äôs show, big bang theory or how i met your mother for similar feels."
Ruby Owen,5.0,"This is the most relatable show ever.I love it SO much.My favourite characters are Rachel Green and Joey Tribbiani.Every time I hear 'How you doin?' I laugh.When I hear 'I got of the plane' I cry.And when I hear 'We're getting a baby' I cheer.I totally recommend watching it.You will not regret it.I have watched all 10 seasons 5 times,soon to be 6.You will find that you will relate to at least one of the main 6 characters.Even the other characters like Janice and Gunther are great-but none of them are as great as Pheobe Buffay, Monica Geller, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller,Rachel Green and Joey Tribbiani."
Sakhi Mishra,5.0,"It's one of those shows which either you don't know much about or you fall in love with! I, like most people who've not watched the show had an opinion that it is way overrated and mundane but after watching the show from the beginning, it was not long before I couldn't stop myself from watching it everyday. It cracks me up no matter how many times I watch it. It was an amazing discovery for me and others should make it too!"
Kritika Verma,5.0,"I remember my friend telling me about this show back during my graduation time. I didn't listen to her. May that was good. Because I feel now that I have watched it, it made me to get over from the chaos of the new world Infront of me. This series gonna make you fall in love with the true essence of friendship and how it helps you to get over in the hardest times of your life. Further it reminds of the fact that during the age of 20 to 30, you are going to meet transient people in your life and some will stay like the six in the friends where they actually wanted to stay. But yeah it gives you a comfort and life is like this. Do watch it. And you definitely gonna miss the characters. Some series are top order collections like some ideas. :)"
Adam B,5.0,"This is the best sit com I have ever watched. It‚Äôs really funny(obviously), emotional, and interesting. You just want the best to happen to all of them. They even make the side characters extremely funny. Gunther always trying to be included in the group. Mike is actually in my opinion almost as funny as chandler. I loooovvve Mike. But I must say Ross is actually my favorite character. You can have a bad day, then you watch this show, and you‚Äôre having a blast. I highly recommend this show if you haven‚Äôt for whatever reason seen it."
Candy Cone,5.0,"FRIENDS 
 I watched complete series in 2022 within a month.  I know you won‚Äôt believe that I felt it is happening now somewhere they enjoying that friend circle. It‚Äôs feels like they living it , And the last episode was very emotional for me I really wished for more episodes, I couldn‚Äôt control my tears because I really gonna miss them. Now watching them in old age can‚Äôt believe they are not the same anymore. FRIENDS is showing good friendships, Comedy, Love, foolishness and etc etc It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôm in love with those friends"
Rh√©a Mc Laughlin,5.0,"Friends is an amazing tv show, in my opinion, the greatest ever created. It is so much fun to watch the characters grow from young twenty-year-olds to mature people in their thirties getting married and having children. I love how the characters all have diverse personalities,  Phoebe and Monica are so different but they work so well together, same with Chandler and Joey. It is an amazing TV show and I highly recommend it."
Reliant Dental,5.0,"This show is so far the best one I have ever watched on television. Its been years since the last episode aired but it still makes me feel incredibly warm and happy..
I miss those beautiful moments of my life when I was surrounded by my best friends and had everything I ever wished for..But when they left and the group broke it was this show that made me feel happy and helped me to live on the good memories we had.This show covered every aspect of life and their bond makes me feel so happy and jealous...üòáüòá"
Koushani Lahiri,5.0,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S. 

Thank you for always being there for me, be it a boring lockdown day, a rough and tough week at work, or my happiest days - you were there on all days to share my good and bad times! I've never been so much emotionally connected to any movie or TV show ever as I've been with you. 

Thank you for teaching me that it's okay not to figure out everything in your 20s or 30s and still be okay. Because everything falls in place eventually!

Truly, you'll always be there for me. 

Love from the craziest fan!"
Pranita Netke,5.0,"It is the best sitcom , I've finished whole 10 season in 1 month ...... this show has drama , romance but also has some comedic part to lighten up things .
    Phebe , Chandler , Monica , Joey , Rachel and Ross story revolves around this 6 people and every person has different personality it's really fun to watch how they share their love , gratitude , sorrow , apartments even their beds üòÇ...
    This is something you can watch again and again without getting bored üñ§"
Akash Patil,5.0,"I saw lots of web series, TV series, but this is one of the best which really made me laughed by Joey's common sense, Chandler's Sarcasm, Phoebe's heart touching funny story, Ross's Dinasour wisdom stuff, Monica's cleaning sense which is obessesive compulsive disorder and Rachel's attraction & fashion sense. But at last I got too emotional, even I'm hard boy but the last one episode made me cried. Love Joey, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, Monica & Rechell!!! We'll never forgot you. Love you forever..! üò≠üò≠ü•Ç"
Rameen Rizvi,5.0,"The first time I heard about the show was when a couple of my friends were telling me about it. But when I started watching the first episode, I fell in love with the show. I have watched the show 5 times or more. The characters are so charming that you can't help but fall in love with them. This is honestly one of the best shows out there and I would recommend it.  They should honestly bring this back to Netflix. 10/10"
Liana Stanton,5.0,"Possibly the best TV show I have ever watch. This show can make you laugh so hard, can make you cry so much, can make you smile and tug at your heartstrings ALL at the same time.

People who don't like friends really have no idea what they are talking about (in my opinion). 

We couldn't have watched it through though with out the hilarious characters. 
Thank you for giving us Rachel Phoebe Monica Joey Ross and Chandler. 
Thank you for giving us F.R.I.E.N.D.S"
Muhammad Nouman Hamdard,5.0,"I loved watching this show. When it ended, I felt lost, wondering what I would watch next. I finished all 10 seasons in 3 months, and when it was over, I felt heartbroken. I didn't know what to watch after that, and I was sad for a long time. In my daily life, whenever something funny happened, I would remember a character or a line from the show, which made me even sadder, realizing I had finished it.

After finishing the series, I spent a few days watching bloopers, the 2021 reunion, cast interviews, and their other movies. But despite that, the sadness lingered. Eventually, I started rewatching the show from the beginning, but it didn't change how I felt because I already knew what would happen and how it would end, so it didn‚Äôt helped.

I don't know why this affected me so deeply, as I‚Äôve never felt such a connection to a show or movie before. It really left a mark on me. I felt like I was a part of the show, and I was fully invested in it. Oddly enough, in real life, I‚Äôve never been this upset when leaving friends after school, college, or in general, but this show, despite being on-screen (virtual) and broadcasted 20-30 years ago, truly connected with my heart. When it ended, the pain I felt was unlike anything, even more intense than breakups I‚Äôve experienced in my life."
Cat Berry,5.0,"ITS AMAZING ! IVE WATCHED A MILLION TIMESS!! I would definitely recommend to everyone! I'm not lying! It's amazing I love it! All meh friends do! EVERYONE IS SOOO FUNNY! When I'm down I always watch it and I laugh sooo hard of Oh.......MY...GOD!

Somm0742,5.0,"The show energizes the adulthood of these people in Manhattan during an iconic era, showcasing how they lived and dealt with their lives during their 20-30s. The highs & lows, the mistakes, the failures, the past, the future set forth ahead, everything just melts in such a nice way that the sitcom has its own life. Among my all-time favorites, such a joy it is to watch. The sitcom teaches us how things matter to us even when we don't care about them. It tells us how to live a life in the world."
NAPATH P,5.0,"This is the best sitcom ever!! I found this American sitcom from Netflix which firstly I thought this too old, and I definitely cannot understand those old joke. But instead! I found out it was so hilarious. I laugh a lot their jokes and cry so bad gratefully for their relationship. I hope these characters live for real. I watch it so late at this 2021. I hope I was born at that time. I love all of the characters in this sitcom, and I do not want this to be ended at all. Firstly, I thought 10 seasons is overwhelming but now I thought this does not enough. Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, and Rachael, they would be all in my heart forever. However, my favorite character is Chandler. He is so sweet and romantic in his own way, sometimes he is funny even not for others, but I would laugh for him. He is not the strongest man, but I am sure that having relationship with him is grateful. His heart is honest and his smile is the best!!"

Emmanuel Vijay Lawrence,0.0,"Here is a reason to watch this show. Your real life would get tough and complicated as you grow and the empathy of the characters in this show will certainly give perspective to find humor, humility and hope to move through. Not a lot of good TV could do that. All laughs aside, this show has helped many people I knw (+me) through some tough times. Thank you creators and cast for that. 90's remain the best for another major reason."
jack finnegan,5.0,"THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!! Despite only being in 8th grade I can relate to many of the situations. It's a hilarious but also emotional in perfect amounts. I feel so connected to the characters and it is something I can watch in every mood but especially when I need a good laugh or pick me up. Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, Monica, and Ross will forever be in my heart."
Elizabeth Janette,5.0,"I FREAKIN LOVED THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!! this show is so fricking good that i wish netflix didnt take it off. this show taught me how life was gonna be like and how each character went through a stage in their life and this show showed me how life isn't gonna work out the way you want it but if you keep going on and believing in yourself, you'll get the job or whatever you were going for, because life isnt perfect and nobody is perfect. it's all about hard work."
Manuja kasun,5.0,"One of the best shows I have ever watched in my whole life. It is beautiful the bond that they have within each other.  I have watched this so many times. Yet Never getting bored of this. Love every single character. The sarcastic moments are epic. And Pheobe's hilariously written songs are very entertaining. It would be nicer if they made Janice a main character. But still, one of the best sitcoms iI have ever watched."
A H,5.0,"This show has been so amazing and really made me happy during the toughest times...the show taught me valuable lessons about friendship and I am so glad that I could see this show! Friends has inspired me in so many ways and I don‚Äôt know what I would do within this show! If ever had the chance to meet one of the actors I would thank them for inspiring me to be the best person I can be and for helping me. If I could I would give this show 100/5 stars!

PRASHANT SAURABH,0.0,"I just loved it. I never expected the show to be so good. When I first started watching Friends I thought it would just be a normal sitcom with some jokes in it. But friends is something else. No one can ever just watch it one time. You end up watching random episodes over and over again and every time, you laugh harder than the last time. You will love each character, believe me every character is different and perfect in their own way. Ross, Rachel, Joey, Monica, Pheobe and my favorite Chandler. You will learn a different way to live your life. You will understand what love truly is. what it means when someone says ""I'll be there for you."""
Tj Galu,5.0,"The Rolling Stone must have been stoned putting Friends in 38th place of the best Sitcoms of All Time. Friends is not only for adults, it's for the teenage generations too. It's a generational show and you just can't find things like that nowadays. The writing is fantastic. The chemistry between the cast can light up anyone's day. This show revived many people at their lowest. It made people think that they were friends of their own. It's a wonderful show and anyone who thinks otherwise is well... delusional."
Liana Ridzal,5.0,"Last week i finished watching the series Friends for the fifth time and i've already re started it. Friends is actually the best show to ever exist so you can't say it's bad if you haven't watched it, and you can't say it's bad when you've finished it. 5 stars definitely would recommend i love it it's my favourite show. sometimes I even watch it while i'm doing school work and I get distracted but I still do my work. I love the cliffhangers that you can't resist to watch another episode, and the theme song is everything."
Paige Merchant,5.0,"I LOVE THE TV SHOW SOOO MUCH!!!!!!! ITS  MY FAV TV SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love the show because you can relate to it in your 20s then your 40s. I grew up watching FRIENDS I really like that you can have 50 new jokes or50 new sarcastic comment to tell to your friends. Friends has always been my go to show it funny it a really amazing show I have always loved it and i don't think i will stop loving it! I grew up watching it, I have watched it 10000 times and i still get surprised on the things that happen. Its a really great show!!"
Arun Ray,1.0,"The show has its moments but most of it is a cringe fest!!
Especially the on-off relationship between Ross & Ratchel! 
Ratchel basically screwed Ross's life consistently in a planned manner. She is someone who isn't happy with herself and her own choices, also doesn't allow her beau to be happy with someone else and Ross is just too dumb to see. Ratchel essentially neglects the best relationship she ever has with a man, Ross, who has loved and adored her since childhood. Ross is a man who proves, time and again, that he will sacrifice things that are important to him and give up happy relationships for her, all to be rejected by her as soon as he has ended those happy relationships. Although, shortly after TOW The List Rachel cites Ross as ‚Äúgutless‚Äù for not letting her know that he liked her for the first year they hung out, it is Rachel who is more consistently depicted as cowardly when it comes to revealing her feelings for Ross"
Salam uddin,5.0,Just watched all 10 seasons on FRIENDS on netflix in about the space of 2 weeks (i have 5 kids i have to look after too) i forgot how much a LOVED and still love FRIENDS right now it is the day after watching the last episodes and FRIENDS reunion and i am HEARTBROKEN yearning for more theres 1 season of a spin off of JOEY which i want to watch but my heart is hurting because in my mind i have a picture of the gang married Ross to Rachel Monica to Chandler Phoebe to Mike all the couples are around NYC but Joey is in Hollywood trying to make a sucess of his acting career and probably struggling its pulling on my heart string and im considered as a person with no emotion lol he is a grown man with a child mind.....in FRIENDS he he moved out of his parents to live with Chandler who basically provided for him even after moving in with Monica then a while later Rachel moved in assuming she also looked after him finacially too.....so who is looking after him in JOEY......?????  ALL I CAN SAY BUT I KNOW WILL NEVER HAPPEN IS BBBBBBRRRRIIIINNNNNNNGGGG BBBBAAACCCCKKKK FFFRRRIIIEEENNNNDDDSSSSSS PPPPLLLLEEEASE LET JOEY HAVE HIS LOVE OF HIS LIFE TOOOO  PLEEEASEEEE
Simran Singh,5.0,"I can totally see why people call it an overrated sitcom. However, it doesn't change the fact that FRIENDS is absolutely nostalgic for many of us. It is our comfort show. 

Don't get me wrong, it is absolutely funny indeed. I find it hilarious and even though I have seen more 'witty' 'unique' sitcoms out there (which I also love) FRIENDS is the only one I keep coming back to, to comfort myself, to use as a white noise when I am cleaning up. 

It is THAT show. 

You won't regret watching it. 
It's a beautiful show."
Arnavi Mukherjee,5.0,"Ohh lord!! Best sitcom ever. 
Everything in this show was great, their friendship, sarcasm, and the list goes on.. 
All the characters were my favorite but Joey, Chandler, and Monica.
Joey. God he is like the cutest person ever. We both have a similar thing that we both love eating pizza. He can do or leave everything for his friends. And I don't know why people don't ship ROEY but I totally do!
 
Chandler. I love him the most, he loves Monica a lot, has GREAT sarcasm, ( We both have that in common.) i don't know why he had so difficulty in getting girls, I mean LOOK AT HIM!!!! But I guess he was meant for Monica.

Monica. We both are same in most of the things, I also have OCD, ngl but I am also kinda bossy, and I too love cooking, I also have to have everything perfectly or I can't sit quiely. She is so pretty!!

I LOVE EVERYTHING IN F.R.I.E.N.D.S.!"
Daniel Carroll,5.0,"Friends has always been my favourite Sitcom of all times and still to this day

Hilarious , great cast"
Alexis Ennis,5.0,"This show is one of THE best show I've ever watched. I never thought that a show could be this good. This shows explains how life can be complicated but yet fun and enjoy while you can. It explains how everybody goes through struggles through life and how sometimes, not everybody will find happiness, but always keep trying, because there will be somebody there for you! But overall, I highly recommend this show. It'll be worth watching."
Suchi Handa,5.0,"There is no other show like F.R.I.E.N.D.S and there never will be. Watching friends is like coming home. It's funny and heartwarming both. You will relate in bits and parts with every character. If you do not laugh I guarantee you will definitely smile while watching any of the episodes throughout the 10 seasons. And as they say ""I'll be there for you"" they are actually always there for us. It's my personal therapy watch. Can never unlove it. Do give it a watch you won't regret it :)"
Mostafa Jalilvand,5.0,"When I started to watch this series, it was about two years ago and today I finished it. I am not someone who really follows a series to the end except the series that is cool enough to follow it to the end. About this movie, I really lived with it, and especially during the hard times of my life like the Covid-19 quarantine, it helped me a lot to forget about many problems that I had. I really lived with it and I thought that they deserve to see this comment from me. I loved all of the characters but Chandler and Joey are on my top list, and between them, Chandler is my choice because of his funny character and many other properties."

Sumit Kumar,0.0,"The Best Sit-Com of All Time.
F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is something which each one of us should see,'Cause we gon' admire,feel & relate to every bit of the characters. As In our own life,at one point or another we do realize the fact that our Friends are the greatest blessing we've ever had in our entire life. And Being with 'em is what we need to have fun and enjoy the life to the fullest."
Niveditha P,5.0,"Honestly, this show isn't just a show. It's so much more. And sure, people will say that it's just a bunch of corny jokes and it doesn't age well, but that's just people who view the show from a flat point of view. It's a life that everyone envisions for themselves which is what makes it so lovable. The show isn't original but the characters deliver well. You cannot get through the ten seasons without connecting emotionally to them. I've watched the show countless times. I can have this just running in the background while doing something else and what makes it so pure and to this day so popular. It is so comforting and no matter what show comes by this will always be a true testament to what a show should be like."

i love austin butler,0.0,"I‚Äôm in tears! Just finished this show and I‚Äôm speechless! I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how great this sitcom is. My friends always kept recommending this show to me but I never was that interested... Listen to me I‚Äôm telling you! Watch this show and i promise you definitely won‚Äôt regret it at all! It‚Äôs so great and dramatic and there‚Äôs so many deep aspects of life in it! I may only be 13, but this has impacted me so much! It shows the true meaning of friendship and how much friends mean to you. I love this show and if you don‚Äôt watch it then... I don‚Äôt know but you‚Äôll be missing out! I have cried sooo many times throughout my binging and that just goes to show how amazing this sitcom is. You won‚Äôt regret anything!"
Ann mol,0.0,"Actions speak louder than words. The fact that i am writing a comment on a show that has aired 20 years ago(I wasn't even born then.....)and is still aired by Comedy Central itself shows the phenomenon,the show is. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is not just a sitcom; its an emotion.....a feeling that should be cherished. It is basically my stress reliever. No matter how frustrated or depressed or sad I am, one scene from this show is enough to bring a smile on my face. 
       IMP NOTE:To all the fans of the show please watch the video - Tribute to FRIENDS -time of our lives from Youtube. That video is amazing.(I really did cry.....its so emotional)"
Randy Batista Rodriguez,0.0,"To me watching F-R-I-E-N-D-S with my family has been the most wonderful experience! The actors -who I love- are really funny and will never forget 'em. I still watch the sitcom on Netflix to feel younger- hehe. Please these 25 years having you was terrific, hopefully you could make a movie all together."
Shivani Shakya,5.0,The best show ever !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I have watched all 10 seasons more than 10 times and still watching it for the 11th time. I love this show. I watch it anytime and anywhere. It is my all time favourite. Those 6 are giving us some major Friendship as well as relationship goals. It's like a dream squad anyone could ever ask for ü§© a must watch show üòÅ
Sayanti Bhattacharjee,0.0,I don't have words to describe my feelings about the show. All 10 series of friends give me strength happiness and believe everything will be fine soon. It show us if you have right friends in your lifr you can face anything in your life. But when the series finished i don't know what to do in life. I request the makers and the awesome actors that please make more series of it. You don't know how much the show matters to us. And it is help us to live the life positively and full of hope.
VINAYAK KANA,5.0,"Everyone should watch this show at least once in a lifetime. I'm sure everyone will love this show as much as I do. I watched after one and a half-decade after the final episode of friends telecasted on TV, still I could feel the uniqueness and content quality. I could say THIS IS THE BEST SHOW I HAVE WATCHED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND FOREVER."
Akshat Mahajan,5.0,"Friends is an excellent show. All of the actors are excellent and their comic timing is also perfect. It's great entertainment. Friends are talking and living their life, and you see what goes on. The writers have done best work. I have watched this show more than once. Only problem I saw in this show was after season 6/ 7, after which show's comedy content started becoming weak. Overall, I loved it and would recommend everyone to watch it."
Shireen Farouki,5.0,"I am a big fan of Ross, Monica , Phoebe and Joey. The writers on this show are amazing. However, everyone else, are okay actors and the main romance in the show is a bit toxic and overrated, and even though the jokes are hilarious and make you laugh, I think Scrubs is better than Friends, even though Friends is one of the good shows of all time, but it is great cause of great writers. Do watch Malcolm in the Middle.

I love Friends though. Great show. Really endearing and funny. Love all of them."
Manjula D,5.0,This show is and will be one the evergreen shows of all time. This show awesomely depicts the friendship between six friends.  It is a good entertainer and if i may say it is a laughing stock. You can see this show for hundred times and i bet that you won't get bored. I really see the clips every day. It helps you to release your stress and anxiety.
Isabella rojas,5.0,One of the best shows I have watched in my life. This show has so mush heart it‚Äôs incredible. It made me laugh and made me cry way to many times then I would like to admit. I loved everything in it the chemistry between the characters is unmatched. It‚Äôs a feel good show. If you could add more stars I would because this show is the best show I‚Äôve ever watched.
Geet Jamdal,5.0,"One of the best sitcoms I have ever seen. The series was an important part of my life. I learned alot from it. The ending was a really touching. The characters, the plot, the setting, etc. Everything was perfect. It is really worth the watch. I just believe a TV series can be this much good and connecting. Overall, an amazing and wonderful show. And I 'd like to thank the creators and characters of the show fir bringing to us this wonderous series."
Martin ‚ÄúM‚Äù VERGE-OSTIGUY,2.0,"I understand that this show has a cult following and that nostalgia has A LOT to do with why people love it. It ran from 1994‚Äì2004. I was 23‚Äì33 at the time‚Äîprime target audience. These characters (these actors) are MY age. I remember thinking Courteney Cox was so *hot*.

Honestly, however, Friends hasn't aged well. After rewatching it on Netflix, I'm wondering whether it deserves such a following and even if it was that good to begin with. The characters are shallow and vacuous, making them hard to care for. The situations they get involved in are absurd (even for a sitcom). I understand the show was made in the 90s and we were in a different place (I was there), but despite the era Friends is quite insensitive in many regards (pay attention to all the gay jokes).

In short, I didn't like it as as much as when I originally watched it. Had to stop because it was making me cringe. If you want something that's aged better and still holds up in COVID 2020, watch Seinfeld, instead."
Sarthak Kanojiya,5.0,"Classic & comforting. Not just a show for me, it's an essential part of my life.
I already watched it so many times & can watch it again & again without getting bored.
Whenever I feel anxious or feel like things around me are getting out of control, I start any random episode & it comforting to me every single time.
I don't I'll ever get bored of this series."
Hmzzz Songzz,5.0,This show is the best show i ever seen in my life where you can laugh and the cry at the same time. And i remember when the last episode i was watching and all of them put there keys at that moment i ask my self why.... whyyyyy there is ending i want more episode. And seriously i love the cast Rose Joey Chandler Monica Richael & Pheobe i really love them a lot. And i really want them back on TV screens. So please make new Friends series or at least make a movie name Friends where all of them get together and make us laugh and cry at the same time. üò¢
Aoife Murphy,0.0,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!! It‚Äôs the best show off all eternity. Every single episode has its shares of laughs even when isn‚Äôt meant to be a funny one. From Chandler insults, Ross‚Äô fair share of marriages and Joey‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow you doin‚Äô ‚Äú. Monica‚Äôs ‚ÄúI know‚Äù, Rachel‚Äôs hilarious relationships and Phoebe‚Äôs funniest lines. I‚Äôm only 12 but this honestly is the best show you‚Äôll ever watch. I‚Äôve probably watched every episode 10 times or more. Not a show to pass up on."
Maria Mac-Lellan Ussia,5.0,Friends is everything you want in a tv show. It also is fun to watch a group of normal people live the time of their lives when friends are family. The support they give each other and how they make others laugh makes me want to be their friend. Best show ever!!! Everyone should watch it.
Faim uddin,0.0,"Show me better show than this, Best Show ever..

Six best friends, story revolve around them, they have done great job, all the actors acted brilliant. 

The best thing about this show is you can watch this again and again and again and again and AGAIN... :) And you will never get bored of watching this.

Acting, little gags, one liners made you laugh as hell. 

Season 5 is the best.

Overall 10/10."
Sunny Anand,5.0,"Friends is one of the best show in the galaxy. 

The best part was Joey and Chandler. I honestly miss their friendship. 

Honestly the show was sometimes fun, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, sometimes insane, sometimes very funny, Sometimes too stupid, sometimes ugly but always kind of happy. 

All the characters were very flirty and always ready to get to bed with anyone. But the Monica, Rachel, phoebie's bed and kiss scenes were shown much much more than the Ross, Chandler and Joeys.

What I saw that this show objectified women a lot. That was so sad to watch sometimes. 

Other thing was no one was serious on anything. Its all funny from day to night. Everyone is acting hard to be sarcastic funny. 

They are trying very very damn hard to be mature, understand relationships, etc etc etc. But all they do is goof around with strangers all the time. So basically there is nothing to learn from the show except be funny and be with friends. 

What I loved most about this show was that there is always a vibe of positivity and happiness flowing around in the show and that itself is a award winning show. 

Hope to see friends remake, reunion, season 2 whatever comes up. 

All in all this show was really beautiful."
mahima e.l,0.0,"HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS EVER MADE!!

Manoj Parmar,5.0,"Just completed the last season finale episode. Goosebumps and overwhelming. I really really really in love with this 6 character. Each episode have amazing remarkable memories. I love yoy Rachel Green more than Ross or Joey do. Monica you are perfect as you are. Chandler you are one of the iconic comic character with generous laugh. Phebs you settled with the best one.

Thankyou so much for giving me this lifelong living memories. I Love you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Megha Garg,5.0,"Well i have just started to watch friends now, and not even in a consistent way but i can say that friends is the best show made on 'friends', i never left without laugh while watching this show. The dialogue delievery, acting, comic timing everything is soooo cool. I heard about it a lot and wonder why but now when i am watching this, i can understand, this is one of the funniest shows i have watched. üëç"
Shubham Kumar,5.0,"No doubt FRIENDS is the best TV show ever and it will be. Always. All the characters are just amazingly awesome, especially Joey. Yeah, he is my favorite. All the actors have one thing in common, their timing of humor is magnificent. The script is too good. Once you start watching it, you would want to see it daily. Everything is perfect in this TV show.
Friendship, love, support, humor, sarcasm, etc. everything puts a smile on you face. But when it will end, you will cry a lot. Then you will watch it from the beginning. I love it!"
Chloe,5.0,"I love friends soooooo much my favorite tv show by far! Summary of main characters:
Joey: Loves food, great at flirting is kinda dumb but we love him.
Ross: Loves Dinosaurs is a ""Doctor"" who talks bout boring stuff and gets lots of divorces and loves Rachel
Rachel: Loves Fashion, guys, and Ross
Monica: Loves to be clean
Phoebe: loves to sing. she also plays the guitar
Chandler: always tells dumb funny jokes"
Marlon Brando,5.0,"BEST SHOW EVER. I started watching this show because I thought ""what is in this show?, why is it so popular?"",  But after watching watching the pilot of the show it kinda starts growing on me and I finished all 10 seasons in a month. This is the best sitcom ever. You feel what's the characters feels. You are happy with the happy endings and sad with the sad endings. When I finished the show I got attached with the characters and I wanted to watch more and more. Best Show, waiting for the special reunion episode."
Jaaved zahid,4.0,HILARIOUS HILARIOUS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OUT THERE . SO AHEAD OF  TIME . ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT . ITS SIMPLICITY IS WHATS AMAZING YET THE SHOW CONNECTS SO MANY ELEMENTS TOGETHER MAKING IT VERY FUNNY BUT ALSO EXTREMELY INTERESTING WITH SO MANY PLOT TWIST ADDED TO THE PLOT OF THE SHOW . THIS SHOW JUST MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD AND NEVER FAILS TO PUT ME IN A GOOD MOOD
Arun Thirumalai Vasan,5.0,"I have watched rather I binge watched this and it has been beautiful journey. I truly miss friends and curse myself for not making many more. That's one of my regrets which I hope to correct in the days to come. Its a touching sitcom where the conversations are great , laughter is rich and just the right touch of raw emotions. A must watch..."
Ranjana,0.0,"My friends suggested me FRIENDS for the longest time. Since I never watched any sitcoms, I never really wanted to watch friends. But only last year I was pushed to watch this TV's shows, as I was stressed and mentally drained out. I binge watched and finished the entire series in 2 months. And till now, it is one of the best decisions I've ever taken in my entire life! I've no words to Describe this sitcom. If you have never watched FRIENDS, what even are you doing with your life?!! JUST WATCH
I would rate üíØüî• for FRIENDS. #Stressbuster"
aiden cool,5.0,"One of the best shows i have ever watched. I own 4 seasons, so i havnt seen it all, but ever since i heard of it i have been in love with it. The people who rate it one star because its boring and unfunny are just people who think Super Why is intertaining. I love F¬∑R¬∑I¬∑E¬∑N¬∑D¬∑S and wish it was still on Netflix but sadly its on HBO max. In summary it is amazing from everything ive seen. So if you like funny situations, this is your show. Im not amazing at doing reviews but i know this is good."
Ayush Abhay,5.0,"It is mesmerizing. You start watching the season and then you fall in love with the story and cast. It is just beautiful and keeps you intrigued. All of them have acted as if they were themselves in real life. Kudos to the team to create such an emotional, funny, relaxing show. Even its 10 seasons seems less and the audience would prefer more of that."
Catherine Mathew,5.0,"All i have to say is that i am really unhappy that it ended. Many people hate friends cause it is overrated but it is worth all the fame it has got , it is definitely worth all the hype . I cant really say anything else other than I feel sad for the people who haven't watched it. I guess you could say the first season might feel a bit boring to some people but it is definitely worth the wait, it gets better and funnier. Overall a really cozy and funny sitcom which you can watch to sit back and relax."
Sophie Snyder,5.0,"This may be one of the best shows ever in my opinion. Friends is a funny, relatable, binge-worthy show. Throughout the 10 seasons you're able to see what they go through, experience it with them. Even in 2022, almost 20 years later it's still an amazing show. I highly recommend Friends."
#ANGRY LADY,5.0,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the best show ever and i don't think any other sitcom can be made as great,amazing,fantastic,funny,emotional as this.It really is a roller coaster with cliffhangers in the last episode of every season which you cannot resist.every character of it is unique in their own way.I love all of them. I'm not sure who's my favorite. They all are so perfect.‚ù§üíû"
Vijay Balaji S,0.0,"I used never watch sitcoms. But I started with Brooklyn nine nine and turns out sitcoms are fun. And all my friends were so into friends and I never understood why back then. But now that I've completed the entire show in just 5 days, I gotta say. ITS THE BEST!!!!!
The show is full of humor, love, friendship, kindness, craziness! and just so impact in my life. You can never get enough of the show. Its so heart warming and beautiful. Just give it a show, You'll love it."
Geeta Sneha,0.0,"I never thought I'd be watching it. But now that I'm watching, I thoroughly enjoy the enjoy more than any other sitcom. It's just such a cool show to chill around. Just love all the characters( Ross, Chandler, Joey, Monika,  Rachel, Phoebe). If you are searching for a show to take break from a really very hectic day, I'd suggest you to watch this."
Sunrise Enterprise,5.0,"This is the best series i have come across my life (although i am 17) i recommend each and every person out there to watch this series if you have your group which also consists of boys then you should watch it . i betcha whenever you feel sad just watch this ,this will definitely bring smile on your face currently watching season  6 so far the journey has been nice can't wait to see all the seasons"
Allie Fullerman,5.0,friends is one of the best sicoms ever! It is filled with laughter but also shows that life in new york can be really hard and it is always nice to have a friend by your side! If I was having a bad day i would turn on friends and know thst i would laugh until my sides ached! Friends is a 11- 10 reommend!!!!!
Tristan Sauceda,5.0,"I've seen shows like the office, modern family, parks and rec, the simpsons,  just a lot of comedies, but FRIENDS is by far my favorite.

If i describe each character in three words,
Ross- smart, quirky, dinasor lover.
Joey- Funny, messy, flirty
Chanler- jokester, sarcastic, wise
Rachel- Formally spoiled but then matured, drama queen, cries weird
Monica- chef, neat freak, also cries weird
Phoebe- very bright person despite a tough background, quirky, hippy

This is mostly a comedy, some romance."
Ritanko Chakraborty,5.0,"this is my most favorite show ,  watched it a million times all the episodes.  it helped me to stay strong in my hard times and also w can learn a lot from the show.
 it is a master piece it teaches us the value of life and the people we are around. 
 I will recommend every person in this planet to watch the show at least  one time in their life."
caylee ??,5.0,"i‚Äôm not gonna write long essays of reviews like other people do‚Ä¶ 

but i just wanted to say that i love friends with all my heart. my comfort show. when i feel down, i watch a few of their episodes and immediately become happy. they make me laugh harder than any show can. that‚Äôs all i need to say and i hope people who never watched friends, watch it.

thank you, that‚Äôs all from caylee.
peace out !!!"
Aav The lost soul,5.0,"This show was not just a show, it was the best show i ever watched in my whole life. The last episode was exactly means to the same as to the actors, hard to move on. Incredible! Mind-blowing and a beautiful part of our life which is harder to forget and will hard to pass it through. 
Last, i would say "" why god, why?? we had a deal!
I'll miss you guys.. 
If this could be possible then make a reunion episode with all the actors which were the part of this."
Lakshita Gandhi,5.0,"I know this show is more about friendship but apart from that you're gonna witness romance , laughter and more importantly many life lessons.
These friends had many problems in their friendship and other areas but how they handled those with communicating effectively is the major takeaway.
If you watch this you'll know it's okay to normalise things like being single mother, surrogacy , adoption , your friend seeing your sister, your best friend dating your ex and yes your wife being lesbian (üòÇ). 
Lastly you'll learn acceptance for everything from this show 
Definitely watch it .
It's more than a sitcom."
Lucas Milich,5.0,"If you think himym is better then friends pls read as I truly decided which is better: HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER OR FRIENDS

How I met your mother:
Character development- Barney‚Äôs was squandered, lily was the same person, Ted got way worst, marshal got boring and robin was fine.

Friends:
Character development- Chandler grew so much, Rachel is unrecognisable in the last season (in a good way), Phoebe finally finds what she wants, Joey matures, Monica becomes a mother and Ross finally finds the life he‚Äôs always wanted.

How I met your mother:
How it‚Äôs aged- Every joke is about sluts, girls, sex, porn and homophobia. It‚Äôs also racist. Look at this quote ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one reason to wait for sex and that‚Äôs if the girl is 17‚Äù. Like are you kidding me.

Friends:
How it‚Äôs aged- While it was a white cast and there are some toxic masculinity and fat shaming jokes it‚Äôs aged better then himym by a long shot and they didn‚Äôt know the stuff at the time. Himym was made less then ten years ago.

How i met your mother:
Did it overstay the 9 seasons- season 6,7, 8 and maybe 9 could‚Äôve been cut down to 2 or 3 seasons.

Friends:
Did it overstay the 10 seasons- While Season 9 should‚Äôve been the last one every season still has a natural ark and is solid.

How I met your mother:
Romance and comedy- As I said before, it‚Äôs the worst type of comedy. While marshal and lily are cute they are sometimes very problematic. Robin and Barney should‚Äôve been endgame and don‚Äôt get me started on Ted and robin ü§Æ.

Friends: 
Romance and comedy- Not one episode doesn‚Äôt have a witty joke or hilarious one (the comedy has aged surprisingly well) and Monica and Chandler are just hands down the best tv couple. Phoebe and mike are great and Ross and Rachel (while sometimes off) are each other‚Äôs lobsters.

How I met your mother:
Ending- Just nope, no.

Friends:
Ending- 2 syllables: PER-FECT

Friends is way better, you can‚Äôt say anything else."
Sunaina Rani,5.0,"This show has everything an audience demands. It's pure form of friendship let the audience stick to the show. The characters are in the sense are great. No one specifically not good. 
Everyone did a great job. Thr funny scenes are the best and that lame jokes by Chandler, Monica's cleanliness, Phoebe's Smelly Cat üòÇ, Rachel's wedding, Joey's girlfriends and Ross's love the Dinosaurs were terrifically great to watch on the show. Best show ever. Will watch it again and again ü§£"
Elena Demetriou Year 13,5.0,"This is the best show I have ever watched. I have watched every episode and I watch it over and over again everyday. I‚Äôm literally obsessed. I‚Äôve got some friends stuff in my bedroom and a friends phone case. I have a friends board game where you answer questions about friends and I win very time because I literally know everything about it. The show is very very funny and entertaining. If your feeling down, just watch friends, it will brighten your mood in a second. If you want a laugh just watch friends I really recommend it."
M S,5.0,"If I could give this an 11/12 out of 10, I would. Just love these guys, esp Joey and Chandler. The best comedic physical acting ever. They are the best- these 2. Phoebe, Monica and Ross are lovely too. Don‚Äôt really like the Rachel character though but tough as that‚Äôs how the writers wrote her."
Anirudh Roy,5.0,"This show is a sitcom but throughout the ride u will feel every emotion in you.....but laughter tops them all.....cannot compare Matthew Perry to anyone....the best comedian in my opinion to ever live....the plus point of the show is no character is even a slight depiction of the other (apart from loving,caring and supporting)....everyone has a different style of comedy which it makes even more funnier....If I had to compare any of them(with a heavy heart) then Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) would be my favourite friend....God!!!!Can he be more hilarious?.....Seriously,comparing anyone for me is a kind of a sin....overall its one of the top tv shows and sitcoms and definitely recommended to watch...certainly a multiple time watch."
Jelina Urgel,5.0,Best sitcom ever!! I could never love a show more than F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I have watched the whole series about 10x no joke !! I was obsessed. One of my best friends loves this show as much as I do and we can pretty much quote the whole show. I have memorized the scenes and I always laugh as hard as I did the first time I watched it. The characters are so lovable and funny. I cried when they took it off Netflix. I just love this show so much.
akanksha kumari,5.0,"Great TV series I had ever seen.... everything is there in this show was great ..value of friendship....how to care feelings  about the people around you ....fun....got little flirting skills...nd I love Phoebe she is so funny , innocent,naughty as well as most emotional...nd I like Rachel she so stylish... Ross's character was good as a friend as a brother but not as a lover..like he was so confused about Rachel after 1 break up.nd keep going out with different girls but poor Rachel keep waiting for him.. ..but I must say Joey also deserves a good happy ending ....it was not happy ending for him...his agent died nd his all friends left him all alone....I wish u guys can release one more season and give him a happy ending"
its Kyras06xo,5.0,"I absolutely love this show, it is definitely one of the most enjoyable shows I have ever watched. I've never got bored watching an episode, each one is so funny, even in the most serious of situations. The characters are all equally as entertaining and it is impossible to choose a favourite. If you like to laugh, I really recommend this show."
Mabell Mercure,5.0,"Amazing! This show truly brought a change in sitcoms as a type of media. The humor, the actors/actresses, the vibe, and much more make Friends a one of a kind sitcom and TV show. There will never be a show like Friends. In my eyes, it's the best sitcom to ever hit the air. I still frequently watch it on HBO Max and some reruns on Nick at nite. I recommend giving this a watch."
Tarun Lochib,0.0,"THIS IS THE BEST SITCOM EVER!!
No matter what type of mood are you in it will always make you feel better, i love all the characters from this series.they all are so funny and lovable.
and as they their theme song says "" I'll be there for you "" it's so true they always be with you and make you laugh. 
Thanks to all the cast and crew members for making us laugh for Years and years to come.

Ava Samimi,1.0,"First of all i have nothing against sit-coms in general, I like some of they actually, but ""Friends"" isn't even that good, I wanted to give less than 1 star for this ridiculous show!! This is seriously the most overrated TV show I have ever. seen and It's really not funny at all, believe me:
I mean it had nothing from itself, the reason everyone loves it and say WOW FRIENDS! THE SHOW MASTERPIECE, LOVE THAT SHOWWW is probably because they have a crush on the actors or actresses in that show.
It had no purpose, the director and actors didn't know what they were doing man! I loved Chandler, Rachel wasn't bad she was the most beautiful girls compared to Monika and phoebe. 
AND:
I hated Monika, Phoebe & Ross! I CANT STAND THEM! I truly mean it when i say, the characters ARE NOT realistic."
Kristine Lee Lumanog,5.0,"its a great series, it teaches many  lessons in life. About family, goals in life, marriage, ups and downs, regrets, opportunities, love, understanding, support, sense of humor, decisions, and specially FRIENDSHIP....THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES ID EVER WATCH . SINCE I WAS IN ELEMENTARY TILL NOW... i will never ever be tired of watching this over and over again... KUDOS TO ALL...."
Kokila Singh,5.0,"I can't even begin to say how great,wonderful, amazing, Fun Show this is.
I have literally started friends 8 months ago for the very first time and believe me in these 8 months I have watched Friends twice and I'm not even over it.

Even 10 seasons seems short.
It's the most amazing show. ‚ù§"
Jason Casell,5.0,This show made me laugh and cry. I‚Äôm so sad that it‚Äôs leaving Netflix. This isn‚Äôt just like any other show it‚Äôs an amazing sitcom about a group of friends who live in New York. It teaches life long lessons while making you laugh.

pn menon,5.0,"All my friends used to tell me friends is a great tv show, all their discussions somehow had reference to events or characters in the show, so completely annoyed and fed up I decided to watch the show, It was mind-blowing and I have never laughed like this in my life watching any kind of movie/tv series, it is so beautiful, not all politically correct and with the greatest casting and writing for a sitcom in our and our parent's generation and most probably for another 2 generations.  If u haven't watched , don't worry you will eventually watch this masterpiece , u cant escape that fact"
Sravan kumar ch,0.0,"The more times I see friends the more I am falling in love with it. It hasn't been an year since I started watching friends and I had already watched it 2.5 times. It's amazing. Whenever I feel low which is pretty much very often the answer is friends. Awesome series I will love it for life and no other series can beat friends.
Best sitcom ever. Monica's my favourite character with joey at the next favourite."
Aditi Suvarna,5.0,THIS IS SOOO AMAZING I CAN TOTALLY RELATE MYSELF TO THIS SHOW!!!!

Jade Chamberlain,5.0,"I am open to any type of category of film and series. I keep myself to myself so I have watched so many different things. Gavin and Stacey was my favourite before watching friends as soon as I did I was hooked. When I finish the last episode I go straight back to series one. I started collecting lots of memorabilia like hugsy, body spray, games, calendars, cards and even wrapping paper. I would buy two versions of things like slippers and clothes, so I could use one and keep the other. Unfortunately some things got broken when I moved house. I didnt have much space either so I ended up having to use most of it. Now I can can replace them. Friends is the best thing ever. I love it!!! I've never really left a review especially this detailed üòÇ. It just shows how amazing Friends is."
Anuja Chatterjee,0.0,"FRIENDS is an epic saga. The script is beautifully funny throughout its ten seasons. It let us feel like one of them . It made us feel like 'hey that's me' . Rachel, Ross, Monica , Phoebe , Chandler and Joey are most amazing tv( or movie) characters of all time. I can watch an episode for the 6th time and laugh just as hard as I laughed for the first. Thank you for creating this masterpiece!"

Purbita Goswami,5.0,"This series !!! Man oh man. I can never ever replace this with anything else in this entire universe. I would choose watching Friends and only friends for the rest of my life if given an option. The characters feel like your real life friends, they become a part of you. Matthew's passing has been really tough on all of us. What a legendary series this has been. I think this will stay relevant forever, for all generations to come. Thanks to all six of you for giving us a masterpiece. This series can never be replaced. Never.

Forever,
Your fan ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Rupali Kapure,0.0,"The F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV show is the best show ever and will continue to be one! Words are less to describe it and to praise it! Each character of this show has acted very deeply and tastefully! The script is written wonderfully and thoughtfully. The dialogues specially are very well done. One can't stop just by seeing one episode, believe me! And I feel very proud and happy to say that, ""I am the biggest fan of friends TV show!""."
Millie Eltringham,5.0,"This show is the 1 thing that was missing out with of my life. It is AMAZING!!! I can‚Äôt even start to describe how good it is.

Alan Austin,5.0,"This fabulous sitcom follows the lives of six reckless young, naive adults living in Manhattan, as they indulge in hilarious adventures which make their lives both troublesome and happening.

It's so illustrious that I am absolutely certain that in 400 years into the Future, that this show will continue to play for millions of happy viewers to come. I would recommend this show to anyone."
Ami Chung,0.0,The BEST thing I have seen. This show made me laugh even when I was going through lots in my life. All of the characters are so hilarious and the last episode had me thinking what I should do with my life now I finished the whole 10 seasons. Hurry and watch it while it is on Netflix. No regrets.
Bhavya v sridhar,3.0,"A lot of us in India were introduced to sitcom culture because of FRIENDS and I am one of those:) and like most of them, I too ended up watching this several times. And over the years, after watching many more sitcoms that came before this one aired, I realized why this isn't ""comedy gold"", overrated and how much it has stolen from other sitcoms, how inappropriate and ridiculous certain jokes are. Apart from all this, it is a decent watch with one of the best endings but certainly not the best sitcom ever made."
Leah Tom,2.0,"at first, I saw lots of t-shirts about friend and I thought they got popular because of the song. but when I realised it was shown. I fell in love with it.
when I got my new house, we watched a random channel and there came the popular show.....FRIENDS!!!! I was like OMG this can't be happening. i was in shock. when my sister started watching it, I fell in love automatically. i love that show.
although there is lots of ina appropriate words, its still very fun to see it. every single one of the actors are super amazing and very talented. i don't know which character is the best. but let me tell u one thing, I love u friends. and sadly, they are don't have any more acting going on. but luckily, its still on tv.
thankyou so much for brinign that show up, otherwise, we would be bored with nothing else to watch. i love friends. And I even have lots of stuff like calenders and bottles of it."
Ma. Nikki Mae Canedo,0.0,THE BEST! This show will make you feel like they're your friends too! I always watch this whenever I'm down. This show became a part of my life. I never cried when there's some proposal on tv or a series about to end but with this? It literally broke my heart into pieces. I literally didn't quite function for the last 3 days after I finished watching the last episode. BEST SITCOM EVER!!!
Cheri Strydom,5.0,"The best show that has ever existüëèüèª
I would always say no thats an old show and i wouldn‚Äôt get the jokes! 
But that show felt like home and I just want to rewatch it al over again. 
It brings so much comfort and I would recommend it to anyone!

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever cried that much with the last 3 episodesüòä

This show is just heart-warming!!!"
Yogesh Patel,5.0,"The most amazing series i ever seen in my life. in beginning or in 1st episode i don't took any interest . but after some time i take interest and the show was very funny and heart touching for me the bounding of all the friends are very good i didn't understand sometimes jokes but it give me very good vibes to learn and for understanding  english  

neither any show beet this show in future in comedy"
madhuka laksara,5.0,"Best Sitcom ever 
I learnt very much from this series about New York and how life goes on generally in the USA. I'm a foreigner who learns English as a second language this is very helpful to understand English and idioms and more vocabulary easy to follow and pretty catchy from the beginning.

I would recommend this to any English learner fun way to learn English and improve your listening skill"
LORNA DOONE,5.0,"Will always be a FRIENDS addict!  If anyone know what episode (and where I can watch it) it was when Joey and phoebe make believe there is a gas leak in Monica‚Äôs place‚Ä¶..she‚Äôs in Vegas on her honeymoon‚Ä¶I think Phoebe cursed in that episode when she realizes she no longer has Monica‚Äôs keys and says to Joey, ‚ÄòOH $HIT I don‚Äôt have the keys‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶just wanna rewatch it to see if I remembered it correctly!  Thanks"
Danielle Gallardo,5.0,"They just don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem like they used to. Such an awesome show. The first season is definitely my favorite and I found myself cracking up even though I‚Äôve already seen it. I love that the episodes are short too. Great show to watch if you‚Äôve never seen it.

Spoiler alert: I will say, I remember really disliking when Rachael and Ross were on and off, the ‚Äúwe were on a break‚Äù got really annoying. Can‚Äôt remember what season I started to get annoyed with it."
Lauren Stanger,5.0,"Yay.
I said yay can you hear me?
Sorry I just have to make this review 30 characters long in order to submit it
You should also try watching Gilmore Girls
Don't get me wrong, you shouldn't talk about another show in a review about another show, but Gilmore Girls is also a very good show.
If you are reading this, thank you for your time.

And no, you will never get back those 53 seconds of your life you spent reading this...unless you took longer."
Vini Kaushal,5.0,A must watch show. It is a perfect sitcom beautifully scripted. It has made us laugh alot. It has made my tough time in this pandemic a lot entertaining and enjoyable. I want to keep watching it again and again. It is my favourite show. I totally love it. I recommend everyone who has still not watched it to please go watch it if you don't want to regret. You are definitely gonna love it.
Rakesh Das,5.0,"One of my friends suggested me this sitcom to watch. I watched each and every episode of all 10 season.I could not explain the impact of this show I mean this is the sitcom will never be gonna old.Chandler is one of the characters protrayed by mathew perry is my favourite.Ross,Rachel,Monica,phoebe,Joye..love you gyes.You gyes will remain in a special position in my heart.Tear is not enough to watch the last moment..LOVE FROM WEST BENGAL,INDIA.i could vividly remeber that imaginary guy whom phoebe was in love vikram bannerjee..haha.."
Lana Lorenzen,4.0,"This was a good show. The ensemble was bright, witty, and intelligent. But I wouldn't rank it with Fraser, Will & Grace, and to some degree, Mad About You. Friends didn't have the caliber of comedic actors as the above. The most talented actors include Jim Parsons, David Pierce, and Sean Hayes. These actors were spectacular in their roles."
EzBeats,5.0,"I really enjoyed this series, and it was the best series I've ever seen in my life. 

You will really miss friends after you watched the whole series.
Whenever I'm angry or sad, I watch this and the magic works, and I get so much better!

It is very, very funny. Everybody has to watch this.
You might also learn a lot from this beautiful series!

Don't miss it!"
Mihir Manyam,0.0,The show as it moves forward gives you some deep feelings about life. I Loved Ross & Rachel and others getting no less credit. Damn I binge watched. It would have be more exciting if I were born and be able to watch when it started. Monica's flat and Central Perk are the places which can otherwise be called Paradise. Each one is true to their self and work on their passions. That's how it should be.
Shremoyee Mandal,5.0,"Omg, this show ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Trust me, the characters will make you fall in love with them. And just as the name of the series suggests, their bond is so so special. Moreover, kudos to the scriptwriter/s, the punch lines are mind-blowing. The show is hilarious, and at the same time, beautifully depicts the journeys of a group of 6 people. A must watch series. üòç"
„ÉÑTiffany,5.0,"FRIENDS is an iconic show from the 90s and it's popularity is rising in third world countries like India. I used to watch the show 4 years ago I was hooked on it but naturally I grew tired of it. 


For a show this old, it's really good. But seeing the show now the laugh tracks are uhmm a no from me. 


In reality, if the characters of friends were realistic, they'd make really bad friends and bad personalities. You know what I mean. 

Either way I love friends but it's outdated now. This is not really related to the topic but comparing Friends to sitcoms of today like Brooklyn Nine Nine, I'd pick B99."
Ladi Agbatar,5.0,"Omg!!! Best show ever! I don't know why it took me so long to watch it but I'm glad I finally did. Although I'm just on my third season(which I watched in two days!), I'm obsessed with it! I'm glad I don't have to wait for episodes weekly, I can just watch them all at ones. I highly RECOMMEND this show to anyone who loves good TV!!

Also, did I mention? It's the best show ever!!"
Imani Chapman,5.0,"Im 10 years old but this is the best show ever i love the one episode where ross & rachel sing baby got back to emma and it goes like "" I Like Big Butts And I Can Not Lie You Other Brother Cant Deny When A Girl Comes In The With A Itty Bitty Waist And A Bit Ole Round Thing In Yo Face You Get STRUCK"" and monica , pheobe , joey , and chandler walks in on them Its Just Great and you would love it"
Mritunjay Kumar,5.0,"I was on season 7 episode 4th I think, and then out of a sudden I threw my phone away, unplugged the earphones.
 It is the scene when Phoebe enters the screen out of nowhere with a guitar playing a song of her own.
 It's hard to laugh that much especially when u have undergone a surgery for appendectomy. It hurts at the stitches man seriously. I have decided to watch after a while.
BTW love for team friends... Especially Joey..ü•∞ü•∞ü§©"
Kamiya Gibson,0.0,"I think it‚Äôs the best thing to human kind.This show makes you laugh and sometimes cry.The characters are relatable, mostly Chandler and Ross.But all together I think that this is the best thing to ever happen.And I think that it should come back for a movie to catch us up to what has happen through the years.My favorite character would have to be Chandler.But again this is the best show ever."
Swarnim Verma,5.0,"I absolutely love love love this show so much. They are like my family. I dont know when and how i fell in love with monica, chandler, phoebe, ross, and joey. But this show can promise to make you laugh, smile, and cry. And the finale is soo emotional. 100% worth watch heck more? Like 1000%"
Lokesh Kumar,5.0,"A show to just relief of any pressure on self and make enjoyable.!!
The best Sitcom I have watched.
Even though it had come in 1994, watching in 2019 didn‚Äôt make any difference such as watching an Old show which is 15 years earlier .
A must watch for some good laugh"
Basanth Jajur,5.0,"The first sitcom i ever watched , its a life time favorite series for me. i don't know how many times i watched this one . every time i watched it brings me smile . stress bluster .

Andrew henneh,5.0,"I sometimes saw friends come on TV and I never really understood all the fuss about it, until after nearly 7 years of watching it on and off on TV I decided to finally watch 1 episode, I watched the pilot and from there fell in love with the show. Friends was the spice I was missing from my life and now that iv found it I'm never letting it go. I connect with all the characters and am physically and mentally unable to stop watching. I love Friends"
ROHIT OJHA,5.0,"This was the first American sitcom tv show I watched. And I got to say that it was absolutely amazing and hilarious too. In Each and every episode of FRIENDS you will laugh, laugh and laugh. Everyone who is a fan of watching tv shows must watch FRIENDS once in a lifetime. #A BIG FRIENDS FAN."
Viswapriya D S,5.0,"Watching this show 8 years ago was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made in my life. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how happy this show has made me feel at my lows, it has comforted me so much! I can watch it all over again at any point of time in a day and wouldn‚Äôt think a second to start over!"
Smack Petersen,5.0,"This is the best sitcom i have ever watched and i will watch it allover again whenever i get a chance. I just feel connected to it, it taught me a lot about friendship and relationships. I was wowed by everyone's acting in this comedy, especially Joey - that guy is so funny and hands up to the writers and directors, this one is the best."
Radio30europe Rock2007,5.0,"So perfect the 4 first seasons, good is the 5 and 6 season but the last ones are good or meh. The last season it is so good I laughed a lot, but the 7, 8, and 9 seasons are meh. I love this sitcom, one of the best of all time, for me, it's 5 out of 5. by the way, the characters are the best, my favorite is Chandler and Joey, Monica and Phoebe too. I was too hard with 7 to 9 seasons, they are good, but no that funny like the first ones and the last one."
Krishnanunni U,5.0,First time in my life i am totally addicted to a series. This series is showing a great Life time. After last episode i am crying. How can i watch more F R I E N D S.

Bidisha Ghosh Chowdhury,5.0,"My all time favorite is and will be forever F.R.I.E.N.D.S
I am sure each and every one of us could relate to atleast one of it's characters. No matter how old it gets.. It becomes more fun to watch...even on repeat. Certainly one of the best and i would suggest to those who haven't watched it yet.. Just start watching."
Domingo Santiago,0.0,"I have to say after scrolling through a lot of these reviews,I concur so very much with all of them I saw the series on DVDs in 2010  I have to say I loved the king of queens,everybody loves Raymond but FRIENDS was by far the best sitcom ever produced I cannot think of 6 people that could of done a better job.Every episode was full of laughter,fun,and had meaningful teachings of how real friendship was supposed to be like.some people won't admit how many times they have watched the reruns I will confess I still watch a few episodes every day OMG!"
Corn Blaster,2.0,"I watched friends way back in 2012 for the first time. 
I remeber enjoying it. It was funny and pretty good. Back in 2012 I was 17.
I revisited the show to enjoy the nostalgia and fond memories of my young adult days in 2022, and i gotta say, I hate it.
especially after season 4.
and the main reason for for me hating it is the two characters, rachel and ross.
back in 2012, i found these characters and their interactions funny.
but today when i have matured emotionally, i find these two one of the worst people you can find in a friends group.
And i dont know if these characters were intentionally written that way or not, but Nope, cant go past season 4.
They're the most selfish, annoying and disingenous characters ever written. They literally overshadow the other 3 nicely written characters with their filth."
Diksha Madaan,5.0,"Best Show!!
i have heard alot about Friends but never got time to watch it but due to lockdown i decided to watch this show.
This show is my fav i can watch it anytime and never get bored of its has comedy,emotions etc.i Wish the ending for joey must have been different though.All the characters are may fav they have different personalities and i love them all.whenever i feel bored,low or can't decide what to watch i just simply watch this show."
Benjamin AirPlay,5.0,"I remember Watching friends I was in My teens Is one of my favourites TV show  love watching so much That‚Äôs my best characters in favourite is Cantler Is my favourite character I remember, Mathew Perry When he first Started the sitcom I loved it it‚Äôs one the best  moments he made People love his style It makes you cry And warm hearted Everybody loves him Jennifer Aston  David summer Courteney Cox , Lisa and Matt Loves him They always are the best friends, and Matthew Perry best wishes we love you"

There's no ‚Äúright‚Äù number of friends you should have, but research says most people have between 3 and 5 close friends. Friendship is necessary, but it can feel challenging to find people who really ‚Äúget‚Äù you.

Charly,0.0,I‚Äôm only twelve but Jesus Christ this series is AMAZINg. There are brilliant plot lines and twists and some Tod the gags are pure genius. It is such a simple idea and really amazing that the writers pulled it off so brilliantly. I‚Äôm completely in love with the characters and the sheer simplicity and brilliance is awesome.
Felix Wallis carnie,1.0,"Friends isn't even that good. The real reason people watch the show is because of their celebrity crush on Jenifer Aniston. Nothing is intriguing when it comes to the narrative of the show. Ross and Rachael's relationship is tedious and tiring, while Phoebe and Joey continue to deliver jokes that make me want to jump in front of a train. It's comedy is bottom shelf, and contrary to popular opinion, i find it's character development poor. It has become iconic, ( i do not know why)  and people like because they know that it is 'meant to be good.' Friends is an embarrassment to sit com's reputation. It objectifies women in a derogatory form and has nothing interesting about it. I wish the 90s was deleted from history and we could just get on with life, leaving Friends and everything else that is attached with it behind us."
Piyush Chaudhary,5.0,"Do not watch this show!.......the moment you watch the first 5 episodes & bam!...you are an addict now. The show has a beautiful story line with laughter, emotions, playfullness, romance. the first day i watched 5 episodes the next day i watched 12 and then started finishing whole season in just one day!...The show will make you fall in love with it, each character has been given equal attention so choosing your favourite is quite difficult, they are just so lovable."
Ellis,5.0,"I wasn‚Äôt born when friends was on and when I was 5 months baby never seen the final of friends when I was just young. 

When I moved to a flat I‚Äôve started watching it in 2021 during COVID-19 Pandemic hits and started full of love of it already when I‚Äôm growing up when I was 22. 

In last year I started to watch the reunion it was very enjoyable and certainly emotional to see the actors are getting older and in this year I started to say a famous phrase of friends a lot of times to make my family a laugh so hard."
MusicofPal D,5.0,"Friends is not just a TV show but an emotion and a guide to all generations that everything will turn out OK. Honestly Friends is the only show that I can keep coming back to anytime. The characters, their stories (except the story of coupling Rachel and Joey) and the impeccable acting all collaborate towards making this one epic show of all times."
Rashmi P,5.0,"Friends is not a TV show. It is a phenomenon because it happens once in a lifetime. One of the most endearing, funniest and genuinely the best sitcom that I have ever come across. All the characters are unforgettable, their antics adorable and most of all entertaining. I have watched each episode more than once still I can't have enough of it. I love F.R.I.E.N.D.S."
Priynandini Gupta,5.0,Best thing that happened to tv....seriously FRIENDS not only is funny but the situations are so realistic like getting fired from ur job getting over exes and everything is so well portrayed by The actors amazing writing and amazing acting = FRIENDS the greatest sitcom in the history of sitcoms ....I mean it‚Äôs amazing and charming once you watch ull want another re run and one more and another and more !!!!!!! I love it my favourite sitcom
Anshu Rami,5.0,"I don't think this show need any review .
It's that kind of show that you can watch any time any where whenever you want you can bing watch it you can watch it during watching any other show. 

  This not that kind a show that once you start it you have to finish it. Many people says it's overrated or not funny or boring etc.. but in my opinion it's most funny show you'll find on internet. 
  
  Every character is funny can make you laugh some point it'll make you cry, it'll tell you the real meaning of friendship. 
   
  If you want to watch it then watch it, you don't want to watch it it's your choice it's your loss because you're missing something beautiful in your life."
Akanksha Sinha,0.0,"The best english serial i have ever seen till now..all characters are so adorable ..acting is superb and i am 100‚ÑÖ sure almost everyone liked this serial...best for teenagers and adults ..i loved mathew perry and matt le blanc a lot ...and in girl's character ..everyone loves ""jennifer aniston"" a lot ..so me too ..i have learnt good english speaking and knowledge of new words from this adorable serial and i love it .. And (joey doesn't share food) is the best line ever !!"
Aditya,0.0,"I started watching show with this one. It is my favorite TV show . I recommend it to watch as a first show of your. In starting Rose is so dump but turns out he is the guy  who enjoyed most in FRIENDS. Love Chandler' attitude. I watched all seasons at least 3 time , and I never bored . As much I watched it , it's getting better and better. üòÄüòä"
purple glasses,0.0,"At first glance you would think Friends is just another one of your generic sitcoms, but the more you watch it you realize there is something in the show that reels you in, comforts you, makes you laugh and literally gives you a friend (no pun intended). There's a reason why this sitcom is a cultural phenomenon and is still appreciated by many even after more than a decade later. I would make my children watch this someday in the future. Simply an amazing show!"
Amanda Bass,0.0,"the best tv show i‚Äôve ever seen! i think that they are like my friends! i love chandlers jokes, rachel‚Äôs spoiled ness, monica‚Äôs ocd, ross‚Äôs dinosaurs, phoebe‚Äôs weirdness, and joeys love for girls and food. i always will have my heart in this show. i‚Äôve watched it over and over again till i basically know the whole script. i recommend for everyone to watch it and have a place in their heart for friends."
Anshul Goyal,0.0,"Humour in the show is amazing.
I love it when Rachael argues with confidence and when Ross got confused or act dumb, when Monica takes the incharge, when Pheobes make a weird choices and when Chandler got too romantic and tell awkward jokes and when Joe flirts or when he acts like a kid.

The show is amazing. But remember, take it in small doses, because, damn, it is addictive."
Michelle Zauner,5.0,Loved this sitcom! We still watch the reruns! I wish the reunion show that I've seen snippets of was actually the show continued from where they left off plus time apart. Not like in the snippet I seen where Monica and Chandler(who were married in original show) are catching up with what they have been doing. They were suppose to have been married raising two kids away from the city so they should already know what the other was doing! Not a fan of the reunion show I've seen snippets of at least not so far. We'll see!
Alexis Ashikwe,5.0,"I am about to spit some friends FAX... This show made me laugh, cry, scream and just relax. I have re watched this show so many times I can quote it... Some basic people hate on this show because unfortunately not all of society has good taste. If you have not watched it, watch it. Also many find that Ross ruins the show which is... controversial... so if you dislike him just pretend hes like background sound and ignore him. Also be aware you may fall in love with Joey ;)"
Nidhi Vig,5.0,"BEST TV SHOW EVER! I personally didn't like Friends in the beginning because I saw my friends all fascinated, talking about the show all day. I used to get annoyed that what is it in this series that everyone is watching it? Now I know the answer. It's my favourite show. Whenever I have a bad mood, I see any random episode and that makes my day.FRIENDS isn't a show, it's literally a feeling! I love this show a lot. I can't describe how much I love this show in words.."
upasana saikia,0.0,"Friends is something I will recommend everyone to watch..it will change your life. After watching this series you will feel comnected to them. You can relate your feelings and emotions with them.. each one of the character will teach you guys something very important.. I thank these guys everyday for making my life easy..love you ""friends"".."
marcanthony_34,0.0,"I love the show and it‚Äôs amazing but I feel like everyone who watches the show doesn‚Äôt understand that they stole the plot from living single. I find it crazy how living single was one of the best sitcoms at the time and friends just come along and steal the whole plot, from the setting in New York, to there being 6 friends, this show completely took living single and made it their own with a white cast without crediting living single. Honestly racism plays a huge role in this (the producers not the actors). Like I said I love the show, its funny as hell, but this is straight up copyrightü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Jitesh Gamit,5.0,"My favorite Sitcom, You can relate to each of the characters, they are unique. Chandler uses sarcasm to get moving, Monica's childish attitude, Joey's coolness, Phoebe's weirdness, Ross's pride, Rachel's dumbness. They show us what it's like to have a group of best friends. They showed us what's really important. and someday you may have to let them go which may be the most difficult task to do."
Hammad Bokhari,0.0,This is one of the best shows I have ever watched. I watched ths in 2018 for the first time and again in 2019 but I can't get over it. I love all the characters and their acting. Watching an episode of 'friends' makes me feel very relaxed and happy after a hectic day. Their is no other comparison for this show.
kevin mwas,0.0,"watching this last episode really disturbs me, in a good way of course, i guess it was for them too coz i can see their tears are as real as mine.. its just too hard too watch, they spent 10 years doing almost all that can happen in day to day life experience.. and you know what, im gonna watch it again and again and again coz its the best series one can ask for, i just wish their was a season 11, ross and rachel my best part always.phoebe, no one can act as weird as you, you the best,joey and chandler represent the friendship which any to friends can go about, i mean the whole cast was just perfect for the parts, im still waiting for the RE UNION do you hear that mr.director."
Swapnil Sukunge,5.0,"The most amazing series I've watched ever . Entertainment, comedy, drama , love this series includes all of the above and many more stuff . I recommend everyone to watch this series , believe me guys it's worth the time üòç. I'm in love with all the characters . A grand salute to creators of the show üëç."
Sowmya Iyer,5.0,"This show is the best sitcom ever. Every character just stays with you forever. No matter how hard life gets, you will feel better by watching a single episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S....!!! I remember when I watched the last episode, I cried a lot. It was like missing my own friends from my life...A must watch for everyone...!!!"
Tumee Sh,5.0,"I love this show. I don't know how many times I'll watch this in my entire life. This makes me happy. When I get angry, sad, depressed, exhausted, or desperate, I go to Netflix and watch at least 1 episode of Friends. This makes me complete. This leaves my worries behind. It makes me feel that I'm meeting my old friends and talking, chilling about little things."
Shahnaz Akhter12,5.0,"Best show ever i watched in my life. 
I feel special connection with those characters. I wish it could be never ends. 
I've learned that some point of life we have to move on even you're best friends and love last forever.....üíï

shaikh fazlu,5.0,The show is incredible I wish I was born earlier to grow watching it its something we don't get to watch these days everything is filled with vfx editing superpowers etc etc. But this is what's worth watching sometimes I feel like I'm in it you know it's very beautiful show I've got to watch and I think we'll never get anything like this ever but I wish to watch something like this show.

Kinjal K,5.0,Hey guys.. I was watching your series and dint watched anything else in this last month but yours. I completed all 10 season  less than a month.

THERE THEME SONG IS THE BEST. this was second sitcom. the first one i watched was the big bang it was every emointial  but it was great. :D so if you watch sitcom you should watch. you want regret it. i watched show all time ago  and to this day still forget some charcter.
Shea,5.0,"I‚Äôve seen F R I E N D S episodes throughout my life, the show has basically raised me to who I am today. I remember watching it from 9pm to at least 1:30am on nick-nite (the nighttime version on Nickelodeon) and it was at least the best parts of my nights when I got to watch. Me and my friend have been watching this show ever sense we have been old enough to even understand the storyline. I love the comedy and the theme of having friends and sticking up for each other during hard times, etc."
Mohith Chinninnigari,5.0,"F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S
""It's about sex, love, relationships, careers, a time in your life when everything's possible. And it's about friendship because when you're single and in the city, your friends are your family.""
And of course who doesn't feel that way when we hear the word 'friends'.
They make us laugh, cry, annoy, angry and emotional but most importantly they make us learn. To learn the value of friendship, love, career, family and the value of self.
They seem crazy, greedy, irritating but they confess everything to each and everyone of them.
They never leave anyone even in hard times.
Chandler's ""Could i be more....."" makes Monica ""I know"".
Ross's ""we were on a break"" makes Rachel's ""Noooooo"".
Joey's ""how you doing?"" makes Phoebe ""Ohh!No"".
It's not just a show. It's an emotion. It has a soul.
I certainly miss them."
Sarita Robinson,4.0,"The show has staying power. It ran for many, many seasons as a very successful hit sitcom. 

I have never really been able to get into the show the same way I like Will & Grace, Frasier, Seinfeld, Martin and The Fresh Prince. But I will give it 4 stars for making superstars out of its cast, launching some great lasting acting careers and also having strong script writing."
Parker Risser,5.0,"my fav show by far! this is the kind of show you can watch if you are happy, sad, or any emotion, it puts you in the right mood. you'll get really invested in the story lines and the characters. so many roller coasters and plot twists along the way but in the end it turns out as it should. BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!"
Lexi Camac,0.0,"I you have NOT watched friends then you are seriously missing out. I have re-watch friends a good 3-4 times and it never gets old. It's a funny, feel good TV show that will put you in a good mood every time. All the characters are so unique and you fall in love with all of them. you gotta watch it...........its the best!!"
Lakshmi Deshpande,5.0,"one of the best sitcoms ever made.......i am glad i made decision of watching it.it teaches how beautiful life can be when you are with people who love you for who you are and appreciate your uniqueness at the same time.the acting and directing was bang on.every actor got into the skin of their character and potrayed their role excellently.though i didnt grow up at time this show was telecasting ,i am happy i was able to watch this show in my youth and be thankful for what it taught me"
Sujal Gupta,5.0,"THE BEST TV SHOW SERIES EVER!!
As i have seen many many many web series but this one is cant described. It has no words to explain. As it makes feels that we are also a part of it while watching through it. It makes sometime laugh, sad, cry, funny and a part of being their friend and make us one of as part of their life."
Kiara Achini Wijesekara,5.0,"The best of all time ! There's nothing more or less to be said.
I say every generation should watch this. Idk from what I felt, it suits the current times so well. LOVE THE SHOW! 
Comfort series for me always."
Prithvi Prasad,0.0,"What I noticed was , there is no single negative feedback on friends. I am watching friends from 5 years and it never gets me bored. Even when I have exams I watch friends....* Yes I got good marks also..friends power*. It makes my mind fresh, avoids mental depression.
Could I BE more thankful to F.R.I.E.N.D.S.!
I have an instagram account on friends and the respond is ultimate.üòç"
Rori Pepper,5.0,This is the best show ever. It is so sad they are taking it off Netflix Jan.1 2020. I recommend it if you love laughter. Each character is different and hilarious in their own way. You would like this I promise you
P Nunn,5.0,I watch this show almost every single day. I love every episode. And I really feel emotional when I see different episodes. It's like I watch them for the first time every single time. The way this show was written so well that this was absolutely amazing. Some times my days are not the greatest but I can watch this show and always smile. That's why I love this show üòç
Manni Vinayak,0.0,"A amazing sitcom... Have seen 2 times.. It made me laugh so hard ...whenever I am in off mood.. I watch any episode of F. R. I. E. N. D. S... 
I always heard about it but never paid attention.. But when I watch.. It make me like comedy series ..
All the characters are best in a unique way... 
They all have done a fabulous job.. 
Monica with a bossy nature.. N her obsession of cleaning n organising things .. Oh! My god... I can see a replica of mine..
Phoebe  with weird nature in a most funny way.. Her reactions to different situations is speechless... Her acting skills are marvellous.. 

Chandler the most enthusiastic person.. Cheered up all the time. His sarcasm n reactions..."
angela jensen,0.0,"It was good but again you have seen buddy show you have seen them all. 
It was basically a show about issues. Complaining about how their life sucks. 
And one bad relationship after another. Picking apart flaws , catty remarks. 
Yelling, crying. Phoebe's horrible singing and rotating door of men. The off and on again relationship with Ross and Rachel. Chandler's family and issues with women. Monica's issues with her mother, control issues and wanting a family. Joey was a player, and immature. Rachel was spoiled, had parent issues, and ditzy . And then there is Ross, neurotic, bossy,clingy and whinny.
Once in a while it broach a serious issue. But most of the time same issues. 
What I did not get is why they added Mike because it threw the ratio off balance four guys three women. Ever so often it would have a good guest star like Bruce Willis . I used to like this show then after watching again it was not as funny as I remembered."
Jeswinscaria mancherikalam,5.0,"Mind-blowing comedy series which I ever had watched. Do not miss this programme and I strongly recommend it to all aged persons. moreover, the players performed stunning, fantastic, attractive. Additionally, I am a big fan of those who play in this season.
Thanks to the entire cru who participated in this series."
Andrew,5.0,"Simply the greatest show I've ever watched.

I could watch it over and over and never get bored. 

I wish that was an exaggeration to point out how great the show is but it'a actually true, i literally can't count the number of times i've rewatched the show.

Thank you David Crane and Thanks to all the Actors"
Afri Arasta,5.0,"It's hilarious how all these people are rating the show as 1 after watching a few episodes of it almost 30 years after it was aired.
Guys this show was not to give you some moral values or provide some deep impact, it's a light watch. Watch it, laugh it over and get over it. You don't have to analyse everything and make it complicated.
These people lied and hid things from each other and embarrassed each other but still they accepted each other for their crazy selves! I guess that's how real-world friends are. 
And That's what the takeaway of this show is."
Ugonna,5.0,I'm rating this show 10star!!!!!     The all-time greatest...  For the first time in my life I cried at the end of a show..    We all did actually.   No one wanted this to end....   It's amazing how we were all captivated through out the ten seasons.   Every genre in this sit-com is perfectly balanced.  It's sooo hilarious and emotional as well.    If you havnt watched it I'm really sorry for you.
Laura Dawson,5.0,It was very funny to watch and really enjoyed it.  I like Ross and I thought he was very sweet and senisitive person among them. I hope all of them might come back and make friends as film or regular as show. make people have a good laugh and find out that casts are up in friends.
Nishita Chauhan,0.0,"Best show ever......I don't think any web series can be this much fun,lovely,emotional and describe so many relationship at the same time like friendship, love,father, motherhood,brother-sister bond,parenting and every relations are pure.

Bridget Harris,5.0,"Wonderful show.The first episode isn‚Äôt the best but i will always suggest to keep on watching.The final episode is a brilliant ending to a great tv series.Every episode you watch makes you want to watch the next, grabbing on to your attention.All the spoilers are fabulous and well made.

The first season is a great start to the series.One of my favourite parts is when Ross buys Rachael the broach.Rachael then finds out Ross still likes her."
okie dokie,5.0,Its one of the best shows I have ever seen. I totally loved watching all the 6 friends together ; getting to spend all their emotions with each other. This show is hilarious. Once you begin to watch this show you will never be able to stop.

Akshat Dhiman,0.0,"Absolutely awesome!! üëå
This show deserves a 10/10.
It has an exposure to common life problems which normally makes anyone unhappy but show teaches us to laugh at these problems and keep going on and just enjoy life. It's a hilarious comedy show which shows friends will always be there for you."
Venkateswaran Krishnamoorthy,0.0,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S. has always been a great remedy to me for the past 3 years. I have rewatched it for more than 6 times, yet Ross's 'HI' in S1E1 and Chandler's 'Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian' has never stopped funny. It is hilarious that it makes me forget the worries of the day and releases the stress.
In short, best series ever."
Siddhanth B.Hoskeri,5.0,"this show is must for the buddies who are friends . If a man hasnt watched this sitcom then all other seasons he has watched is into the dump.

Vahid Roostaie,5.0,"There is nothing like friends. Full of joy, adventure, zest for life, love and laughter. Several times I have watched it and laughed like the first time.

Luciana Aguirre,5.0,This is one of the best sitcoms I've ever seen in my life! It does have some up's and down's but all in all it's the best show ever to air on tv. Granted that I didn't grow up with it but I'm watching it on HBO Max and I'm addicted. Perfect for binge watching!
Enjoy till last breath,0.0,"You can tell everybody that other shows offer you war, love and some other similar stuff.....but this show that goes back nearly one and a half decade is still the show that you can watch anytime anywhere and in any mood.........it might not provide content like others but it provides content better than others
Frankly speaking, it is the best show ever to hit up your TV sets or your mobile phones or any other stuff. You can just switch to it anytime...and feel awesome"
backbenchers tv,5.0,"this is the best show I've ever watched. It's a must watch show for them, who loves to laugh. several original jokes in every minutes! First time I watched I liked it. then I re watch it & fall into love with the characters. & then I have re-watched it like five or six time!"

Prasidhi Saha,4.0,I started watching friends last year and I think I have made the best decision ever.Its so funny but at the same time very relatable especially Chandler Bing. Every character is unique in their own way and gets better. I love it so much and would recommend it 100 percent
Shanaya Shahalia,0.0,"There can never ever be a show that beats friends. it is simply the best sitcom off time. Infact it isn't even like a sitcom. It is a journey. You feel as if you are talking to close friends while watching the show and you fall in love with all the characters. I watched each episode atleast 10 times and I can watch it again and again. If u haven't seen this show...WHAT ARE YOU DOING????!!!!
You MUST MUST MUST watch this show"
Siddhesh Sawant,5.0,"I am actually surprised and angry both on the rating given to this show. It deserves 5 on 5 stars. No. Again NO SITCOM has been ever made that can reach this level of humour, emotions and happiness. You are sad, you watch it, you are happy u still watch it. I am 28, and i think i will still watch it when i am 60. Nothing can match this series."
Yassa Sobhy,5.0,"This show is amazing!

I love love love this show it is my all time favorite show  hands down."
maddie,5.0,Friends is literally the BEST show EVER!! You can relate to any character no matter what kinda of personality.I am VERY sad that Friends won‚Äôt be on Netflix anymore.I think if they aren‚Äôt going to be on Netflix anymore then they should make a reunion video and post it on Youtube or something. I love Friends!!!!
Aditya Panda,5.0,This show is a must watch show. It might not be as funny as The Office or Brooklyn Nine Nine but this show has a very heartwarming and relaxing effect on you and you will never get bored. I've watched this more than 10 times now and I love it even more everytime I watch it
Ram Niwas Yadav,5.0,"No Words for this Show.

The best show ever made on Friends.

I will simply say just watch the show and you feel why this show is special.

You will gonna fall in love with Joey and phoebe's Character. However, Each character has done their best and they are best the Joey(the struggling TV actor in the show) is totally different. Hey, How you doinüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Ananya Malla,5.0,one of the best web series ever seen . this reminds you of how friends should actually behave with each other and how they should support each other no matter what may it be just a simple problem also. it shows amazing 10 year memories of 6 friends to struggle I'm their relationship. but however make it to 10yrs with the support of their friends. *I'll be their for you*
Swapnali Ingawale,1.0,I always loved watching friends. It makes me laugh everytime at the same jokes it's all fun but today while watching season 8 episode 8 thr is a scene where rose and his girlfriend chatting about a sculpture a statue of our Hindu God Ganesha. Rose and his girlfriend ( Mona ) starts kiss and his girlfriends feet break the statue that scene is so disrespectful towards our culture. I request to Remove it. It hurts our religious sentiments

Palak Mahajan,5.0,"Binged watch this show. 

Its classy  & legendary sitcom which has humour , emotions , romance, drama , comedy.

Its worth watch. You can easily relate it with your own life. 

All characters Monica , Chandler, Ross , Rachel , Joe & Phoebe did commendable job. Each character did justice to their role. 


Season 10 - the last one episode literally make you cry . I wish this show never ended.

I can rewatch this series anytime. 

11/10 from my side .

Seanna Rose,5.0,"This show is my favorite comfort show ever. Whenever I feel down I put on this show and my whole vibe changes, this show makes me laugh instantly esspeacially when Chandler and Joey are in the scene. Thank you to everyone who put this wonderful show together, I have not found another show as entertaining and comforting as Friends."
Elizabeth Pillai,0.0,"The best show on TV. It really makes my day complete. Refresh your mind, u laugh and laugh especially with Joey expressions, Chandler's sarcasm and Monica and Ross Rachel love. Well I really didn't like Rachel's behaviour after they two split up. Because she was the one who didn't understand Ross's love, then everytime he trys to move on she  freaks out and try to drag him down. And later break his heart again. I hate the way she treated him."
Rishaaya Kakar,5.0,"GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH

Ella Norris,5.0,honestly this is my fave sitcom ever. it is funny and shows a message that friends will always be there for you. i took 2 months to watch it but i feel like i have been through the 10 years with them. so glad i watched it
Ropa Roy,0.0,"I've never watched(still watching every night)  something so amazing in my life. I was going through a really bad phase of my life when I started watching it and it really, really helped me a lot. 
For me, it's not a tv series, it's real. I know that whenever they get time, they hang out in the central perk. 
I love them more than most people in my life. ‚ù§"
Pamela Ashley,5.0,"I love everything about this show. I think it's what we all want to be, ""friends "". Everyone having different career's, love interests, ect and just being there for each other. They also care so much for each other ,while being hilariously funny.  I guess I forgot to mention that. They're such a hoot.."
Aditya Pratap Singh,5.0,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S, what to say about this show!! This show is a miracle. This show has everything which a person expects from a show. All the cast members were perfect, I mean they all are irreplaceable. They made us laugh at all the times but sometimes made us cry. This show is the best
                ""It's simply beautiful!!!""
I recommend everyone to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S"
Alex 3,5.0,"I love this tv show, I started watching it in 2018. My mom introduced me to it when I started watching full house. And she told me I would like friends. Now I saw a sense from friends when I was maybe 5 but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to watch it. So I watching on Netflix and fell in love. I watch it everyday, 3 to 4 episodes a day. Even during school. üòÇ I finished it in a month. (I‚Äôm not even joking) It taught me somethings. And it‚Äôs very funny and Iconic"
Ha5jiv Singh,0.0,"It's really crazy but I still watch Friends 4 times a week. There is nothing that could cheer me up like this on a full day. In 10 years, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey made us laugh, cry, think about life, career and love. Everyone has their own personality.

Monica: The mother of the group. Rachel: Spoilt and Sensitive. Phoebe: Cute and Crazy (In a Good Way). Chandler: Sarcastic and funny. Ross: Nerd Joey: Womanizer.

""Should we get some coffee? Sure... Where?"""

It was my daily routine to watch the series and the got to work .Love you Ross ,Rachel ,Joey , Chandler ,Monica and Phoebe oh I forgot to mention Emma +Ben. Please make a Movie on Friends"
Mavis Rosuman,5.0,"There's something really special about this sitcom that really holds a special place in my heart.

Ross. Rachel. Monica. Chandler. Phoebe. Joey. All six of them are the definition of a friend squad that I would really love and eager to join when I have no-one-to-talk-to-kinda-thing.

I don't think the plot matters here whatsoever. But this show just made the iconic characters memorable and easily lovable."
Kiara Lee,5.0,"My favourite show in the world. They were my 'friends' when I was only 9, crying over how my parents were constantly leaving to go to Korea to take care of my grandparents, and when I was dealing with separation and social anxiety this show made me feel so at home. They were always there for me (iykyk)"
Jinu John,5.0,"If there was a 100 stars to give this show I would.
Such an amazing and homely show.... I can watch it over and over and over again. I don't think there is a single American comedy show better than this .

Love each and everyone of them in the show ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Best show ever made in the history !!!!!"
Roshni (Roshu),5.0,I love this show. It is my favorite show. I want to kill Netflix for taking this off but of course I wont. I watched it when I was 9 and finished it in like a month and then I just watched the episodes over and over again. I never got sick of any episode. I loved every single character. I am 11 now by the way. I am planning to watch it over and over againnn once I buy it on amazon prime.
Mary Congrove,1.0,"This is seriously the most overrated TV show ever. It's really not funny. The  characters are not realistic. It's not representative of American life. They rarely go to work. When they have kids they rarely are in the show. Ross and Rachel are the lamest will they won't they couple I've ever seen. The stories are all surface and cheesy. I roll my eyes at this show which is a disgrace to sitcoms. People caught up in the 90s nostalgia think this show is the best ever. However these characters lives don't represent them because they are representative of no one that has ever lived.
If you want a good nostalgic sitcom see Scrubs or That 70's Show. Shows that depict real lives and not some idealistic version of New York living. I don't get it's popularity I genuinely don't and I've tried I've watched almost every episode against my will. I wish I could give this a 0 star. Rant over."
Jennifer Huard,5.0,"I love this show I‚Äôve watched it so much my family got annoyed of it. This show knows what love is, comedy and friendship. I wish they kept going with the tv series but the last 2 episodes are sad. Thanks for bring this tv show into the world."
Sreoshi Das,0.0,"I was not much into watching tv shows but when it comes to friends, its not just a show it is much bigger than that. Friends made me smile, cry, love, laugh out louder , be happy. It was there with me whenver i felt low and sad and depressed and it cheered me up. All my love for six of them.."
Sam,4.0,Yes it's good to see beautiful people. I have a problem with writers cause I hate when ross and rachel refuse to get together even after they had child. It's weird cause there's no reason for them to be separated. Writers did very poor job here. Except that Friends is good. It's fun to watch. you get connected to the characters. Writers too did very good job displaying past events. I am impressed. I suggest to watch Friends if you have 100 hours of spare time.
Ankur Saha Choudhury,0.0,"Best sitcom I have ever watched in my whole life... The show is worth watching... Even after 25 years, it is still the apple of everyone's eye...I guess it's impossible for any sitcom even in the future to match with F.R.I.E.N.D.S... Whenever you feel sad or upset just watch one episode and you will forget everything..."
Colleen Jinx-Cannon,5.0,"Best series ever.  I have watched Friends forever.  I own the series & watch it yearly.  I feel like they are my friends.  They got me through loneliness and cancer.  When I was hospitalized, they were always on the tv making me comfortable and feeling like I was home.  I miss them all and wish them nothing but the best."
Shivansh Panwar,3.0,"This show is quite funny and a bit stupid sometimes.
the way they disrespect the Indian culture is not acceptable at all.
but overall this show is worth watching 
I recommend to watch this show at least once specially if you are into sitcoms 
 Every character brings something unique and funny in their own way maybe you don't like the last few seasons but the first  6 seasons are the core of the show"
Poulomi Banerjee,5.0,If someone is upset or not in a very good mood ... Please please please for god's sake ... Watch this series ... I laughed my heart out watching this series ... Love each and every one of the characters .. i bet you will love them too ... Nd not regret it atall ... It's by far the best comedy sitcom I have watched!!!
Elsie Fogg,5.0,"I love this show I‚Äôm only 12 but it‚Äôs the best show ever I am HUGE fan,I wish they had continued more and maybe done 12 or 13 seasons and we would have gotten to see more of Erica and Jack (the twins) and see Emma grow up! This is the best show ever and I can‚Äôt imagine my life without it lol ü§£ I also can‚Äôt forget about Ben and see him grow up."
Tanishq Rawat,5.0,THE BEST SITCOM EVERRRR!!!!! There can never be a sitcom as good as friends. I just love litrerally love each and every character(specially chandler) and every episode there is. Once youre gonna start watching it youre gonna fall in love too & that's my guarantee.
Naveetha jayaraman,5.0,"The best series EVERRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!.  I have started watching friends series 3 years before and I completed watching once within a year. But I didn't stop watching it over again and again. Till now, I watch at least one episode before going to bed.

You can't choose a single character as your favourite. They're ll gooooood.Awesomeeeee!!!!!
Chandler and Joey's friendship, Phoebe's weirdness, Mounica and Chandler's loveü•∞ü•∞, Ross's fun actions., Rachel's acting,hair everything. U can't resist them. I have suggested this series to few of my friends, but they didn't seem to enjoy it. Idk wats really wrong with them. But everyone must watch and enjoy this. You're gonna love it ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
Sahith,0.0,Friends is my favourite comedy show. If u start watching it and understand the characters I bet you will really love it. My favourite character is joey. I watched the friends ultra marathon and after the last episode is I've I nearly cried because I am gonna miss the show. I wish there is a new season. I hope the creators make up a new season. Everyone would love it.
Nadia,1.0,"For someone that didnt grow up with friends, watched it and find it very dated and cliche. Give props for it being the first to introduce this ""friendship"" kinda sitcom but if it were released now it might not work as well. Storyline and jokes were very simple and not that complex tbh. Its just a no brainer, storyline is barely there. Only character that have actual growth is monica and chandler. This kind of series that might open in background and not focus on. Not worth rewatching tbh but its not bad. Just on scale of other sitcom, def not worth watching."
bhuvan c,5.0,"This is the best thing ever and I am crying right now cause I finished watching it..... 

Ohh if u haven't seen it then what r u doing?? 
It's the best sitcom ever.... 
It will always have a place in my heartüíï

shriya grover,5.0,FRIENDS is the best thing I've come across in my life. Everytime i felt sad happy confused frustrated any emotion I've always watched friends  i have watched it 7 times from season 1 to 10 each and every episode over and over again that now i say dialogues with them but i would never stop watching it.
Ayush Basnet,5.0,"If you have not watched this show then you still have not experienced the world best sitcom ever made. When i finished it's last episode, I cannot tell you how I felt. It's was like loosing my family own family members. That much impact it has on me.  No wonder it is still the best for  millions of people in the world."
Mia K,0.0,"Best sitcom ever! Amazing for anyone from 13 years of age! It is a comedy with bits of the best romance woven in between. Absolute magic! 
I cant even try to rank the characters cuz they are all so fantastic!!!"
Unnati Agarwal,5.0,"i just love this show sm. I feel like i have some sort of connection with the characters, this show is literally my comfort show, although some people do say only the people who are in their 20s and can relate to the show, will only like the show,but i don‚Äôt agree im absolutely in love with this show. Honestly,i can watch this show a million times more<3"
indu singh,1.0,"I did not like Rachel's character at all. The character has no dignity no ethics. Chandler and Ross's characters were good in ethics and but Joey's character leaves his principle at last was not ok for rachel. Monica's was very strong of all, played very well. I truly admire her. Phoebe is so cute and charming could have shown her smart in late seasons at least. Joey is so cute and childlike."
Maari Bhai,0.0,Its my 2nd Favorite sitcom. The character chandler and joey are amazing. The other characters are not very good. I used to love jennifer aniston but after i watched friends i started to hate her. All i can say is that its one of the best sitcoms. its all because of chandler and joey
George Hall,5.0,This is one of my all time favourite shows. While some may argue it hasn't aged well due to some outdated jokes and lack of diversity in the cast. I think it still holds up and is a lot better than some of the older sitcoms out there.
Aria,0.0,"This show is ma all time favourite of ... well all time.

Priceless and genius. Is one of the few shows where I don't care what episode or season I watch. I can just close ma eye's and pick a disk from ma collection and watch it. The show is painfully funny and each character has a joke ""style"" that matches their personality perfectly."
Patrick O'Neil,0.0,"Friends is possibly the best sitcom I‚Äôve ever watched in my life. If you enjoy 90s/2000s sitcoms like TBBT and HIMYM, you‚Äôll probably love Friends. I‚Äôve been watching it for about three years now and I can easily say that it‚Äôs helped me through several stages of my life. I give it 10/10."
gr4ceanne,5.0,"this is my favourite sitcom/tv show. from joey's flirting skills to chandler's sarcastic comments, i just love everything about it. chandler, joey, rachel, monica, ross and phoebe all have their phrases which i love a lot! how could you not like it?!"
Amy Bryan,5.0,"A timeless show!  Every episode, except the last one, had me laughing every time.  The writers of this show are pure genius, the actors/actresses are amazing.  The characters were all endeearing and loveable!  I can rewatch it over and over and never tire of it!"
HARSH TYAGI,5.0,I just love the series the comedy timming story line concept can't regret a second the leads even others were so great like the gellers Rachel's parents and Gunther jannic ohhh myyy goddd!!!!! Best best best i just finished and i am so emotional missing Ross's expressions Monica's freaking organizing habits Chandler's sarcasm Joe a kid in adult's body Rachel's nohrrrrrrr phoebe all crazy talks and 1000000 another things every episode
lakshmi suvetha,5.0,One of Most Connected Series which has all these 6 AmazingüòâCast being Joined as a family to make us laugh little harderüíï Nd cry üò≠ our eyes out nd Showed what the Real friendship meant üòçüíï Can‚Äôt enough word can be filled to say How this Series totally Moves my Heart Flutter nd Warmthü•∞ü•∫
K,5.0,"Could it be anymore funnier? haha but seriously, the best thing ever. I watch this whenever I'm sad and I instantly feel not so bad anymore. I think it would be goto staple for instant TV FUN always. The cast is something magical."
Christine Collin,5.0,"I watched this TV show the last few months and I just loved it so much. There is everything in there perfectly assembled (laughter, touching emotion, passion, love, friendship...). It is so entertaining, characters are very endearing. 
Now I have finished it I miss them all so much !!!!"
Panashe Muranda,5.0,"My friends used to recommend this sitcom but I was so hesitant to watch but I thank God I did , friends is like therapy to me whether I'm sad or depressed it's jus a rescue for me the laughs makes me satisfied,I am sad that I watched wen Matty Perry died because he really carried the show for me ,may his soul rest in peace...but I would highly recommend this one it's the best thing that ever happened to me now I never feel like I'm alone it's like I have friends around me all the time"
Shaoli Pramanik,5.0,Let's say you will appreciate more the friends you have in your life after you have watched this show. I have watched it and rewatched it and it never gets boring. I'll probably never grow out of this series because of its universal sentiment that makes us want to be friends with the six of them.
James Templeton,0.0,"The greatest Sitcom of all time. Is still hilarious even many years after its ending. The characters, humor and longevity of this show are unlikely to ever be surpassed. If you havn't already watched it, its also offers essential insight into western culture and life."
Fabio Ferreira,5.0,"I grew up watching Friends and it is amazing. In friends, the characters are not great role- models but at least you learn something. If I had to pick three favourite characters, I would pick Phoebe Buffay for her caring personality , also Joey and Chandler as they are funny."
Fitz Efraem Caldit,5.0,THE BEST COMEDY SERIES OF ALL TIME! I STARTED WATCHING THIS WHEN I WAS FEELING HOMESICK BACK WHEN I WAS WORKING IN SAUDI ARABIA. IT REALLY HELPED ME A LOT GO THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. I STILL WATCH IT UP TO THIS DAY AND STILL HAVE THE SAME LAUGH WITH EACH EPISODES :)
Sarika Rane,5.0,"There should have been an infinity star option to rate this show. 
It is more than being optimistic, fun, love, comedy, an emotion  
Its truly a beyond one. 
You can watch it as many times and still feel delighted 
It does magic to your mood and your day"
Jaimee Cruz,5.0,"FRIENDS has such intelligent writing!!! The actors were perfectly chosen. The story is so beautiful, touching and relatable. I love friends with all my heart. Thank you Marta and David for bringing FRIENDS to us. And thank you to Kevin for helping bring FRIENDS to life!"
Vedant Mohan,5.0,"Fantastic show. This show is so great for many reasons. It shows the true value of friendship. It has made me laugh, cry, and angry whenever the characters do something dumb. It has a great set of characters and a phenomenal cast. For 10 years these were my friends."
Eva Jovceska,5.0,"It's amazing show. I'm absolutely in love with the casts. Every episode is more and more interesting. I like to make 11 season of friends or reunion, it will be great. Joey and Rachel are the best couple."
Tam√°s J√≥svai,3.0,"The first around 5-6 seasons it was awesome. Then it felt somewhat different, like they ran out of ideas. Rachel, Phoebe, Ross were unlikable characters in my opinion.  The show around the 7th season got boring. And it was not funny. The laughing track laughed more than me. Cliche on cliche. The 10th season was so mid, i fast forwarded to the last episode. That was okay.  

TLDR: Started good, ended up being mid."
Zoya Ahmed,5.0,"This is an evergreen show, I mean it never gets old, each n every episode is an epic one, each and every line or silly jokes.........I don‚Äôt know how they managed to make such an classic coz hats off you guys.!!
 
No character is replaceable I‚Äôd say n everyone is lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
If you haven‚Äôt watched friends yet, do so cause I can tell u you‚Äôll never regret this.......!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è"
H R Pandey,0.0,Best show ever. Could capture ur emotions with every line they utter. Comic timing is legendary. Has capability to get u out of depression. Beats GOT in EVERY ASPECT. No other show could be rated near to it. Gives you a hope that every thing will be right at the very end.
Josep,5.0,"im totally getting SePanx right now.
i was only 14 when friends aired their last episode and i cannot believe it took me 16 yrs to binge watch this amazing show and i cannot get enough of rachel monica phoebe joey chandler and ross :(

Brody Morris,5.0,"The best show of all time 100%

Jennifer M. Matos,5.0,"This, by far, is the greatest sitcom of all time. The storyline, humor and semi-drama all mixed into one just make it more spectacular. I grew up on this show and I STILL watch it every single day. It's timeless."
R. K.,0.0,Just finished watching it's last episode of last series. A journey of their lives of 10 years is now over. It's a wonderful delight. Watching them growing from late teens to mature family person is soul satisfying. How they live their lives and their relationship Dynamics are enriching. It is a must watch for everyone.
KOURANI VIDHI vps.08f03,5.0,"This show is an hit... If anyone is thinking to start seeing pls do it right now bcos it has a lot of comedy, friendship, emotion, connection and ‚ù§.

The comedy timing, story telling everything is so perfect that when you start watching this series you start thinking that you are a apart of this friends circle, and at the end it feel bad that these 6 friends become older like for 10 years and it get finished. But no regret i suggest everyone who is reading my comment to watch this masterpiece."

saman karimabadi,5.0,"I think this series is funny and cool in the beginning and you can fall in love with each of these characters
But very deep and small concepts of friendship, respect, mutual understanding can be learned from it, and while all these concepts are very deep and should be described as such, how did they understand these things? And I admit that this movie is and will be the best series in the history of Badakh
And I can watch it again after two full viewings
I love you all"

kushal bhowmick96,5.0,"Where to start ???.... what to say??
I have seen this series during my colleague 1st year i guess(2015), yeah you guys have read it correct, 21 years after it was first aired. There is not a single thing not good about this series from the plot  to the characters to the story,sarcasm,emotions...etc etc, everything is beyond ""woww!!"".Its just a masterpiece in one word i would say, if you watch after say 20 years(from the time i m writing this review),you will feel the same laughter as you have before by knowing the jokes already!!"
dhriti prasad,4.0,"I love friends. With that said, let's face it, some of the episodes aren't immune to time. There are some pretty trans and homophobic jokes and a lot of body shaming, which doesn't fly in this time period, but with all that aside, I think it's a great sitcom and it's definitely a must-watch.
The characters are memorable, most of the jokes, if not all, are hilarious, and all in all, it's great fun."
Andi Daci,5.0,this is such a good show words cant explain how good it is i have rewatched it a couple thousand times and every time its the best everyone should watch this show im a kid and love it do much every character has something funny and unique about them and they always know when to make jokes this by FAR THE BST SHOW EVER NO CAN BEAT F.R.I.E.N.D.S.

Kanishk Goswami,5.0,"To all the Haters who call F.R.I.E.N.D.S ""overrated"" or ""overhyped"" or lame or old humour.....
Just check the Netflix top 10 everyday, EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! and boom! What do you find? F.R.I.E.N.D.S is right up there. In your face!

And one more thing!
Laugh tracks are not compulsory to make a show funny, but it damn straight doesnt reduce its hilarious level. Rather it is a helpful boost.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S>>>>>>Any other series ever made"

M√†rgaret Jensen,0.0,"Friends was a superficial sitcom full of pretty people. It wasn't even worth
 watching. I got tired of Phoebe's (Lida Kudrow) really bad singing. And 
revolving door of boyfriend 's. Monica's (Courteney Cox) OCD. Ross's
(David Schwimmer) constant whining.Joey's (Matt LeBlanc) black book of
girlfriend's. And Chandler's (Matthew Perry) whining about his childhood.
None of these things make a good show. I do feel bad for three of these
stars and they Matthew, Courteney, and David. Because they have not done
anything since this show as been cancelled. The other three have been
getting all the brakes. And the others are just as good."
Matthew Leonardi,5.0,"My Favourite show, you can watch re-runs, and re-runs, and re-runs, till the point you know what will happen in each episode. This makes Friends an amazing show, a plot that viewers will constantly love, comedy that makes everyone in the room smile, and an amazing cast choice, they could have never found any 6 people more amazing for the show. Hopefully there will be more in the future, even though its cancelled"
Not the One,1.0,"After nearly 20 years friends is back with the same tired  lame show plots and a continued racist approach to entertainment, after all this time the cast and its writers and studio still have not found a black person or even a person of color that they can call a friend,  and we wonder why we have this pervasive racism in this country. This is also the same reason we have cops in this country feeling like they are all Billy and Betty bad ass,these studios, writers, and actors all support this racist view point that they keep shoving down the American publics throat. This show is a microcosm of all that is wrong with American entertainment, Friends deserves a negative 5 star rating but it's not an available option"
Anomitro Paul,5.0,FRIENDS is the best sitcom everrr. it makes me laugh so much like it cannot be described in words. last episode makes me cry so much that i end it with the first episode so it makes me happy again. Chandler is my favourite character. His humor is like üòÇüòÇ
Soolmaz Abbasi,5.0,"The best ever...,
Nothing could take it‚Äôs place..

Yes some say it doesn't have a very good storyline. Its just a bunch of six  people hanging out at a coffee shop, well yes, that is exactly what it is. But it is showcased in a such a way that even you,i, everyone can feel it. It has the feelings of reel moulded with reality in such a way that even after 10years, it is still the most binge watched show.

I love F.R.I.E.N.D.S.. And that wouldn't change for anything. 

Love, 
A friends fanatic."
Sadhin Mohd,5.0,"One of best series ever!! I had finished many series throughout but this is different. It made me taught not only thrilling and lag series are there, there are too entertainers. 


I only hated episodr which the directore and writers telling the speech throughout the episode it make me crazy"
Ganesh,5.0,"Somethings never go out of heats and ""FRIENDS"" one such kind of show. The progressive way of showing sensitive issues like LGBT relations, obtaining motherhood without marriage, adopting kids, giving birth to others kids show hoe the society has been progressing over the years. Best of them is Chandlers ""Sarcasm"". FRIENDS is a bench mark for modern SITCOMS and the show will be remembered for ages."
Carol Priscilla,0.0,The best series ever!! My friends used to always talk about it and i happened to finish watching the whole series in one month!! It is really a treat to watch all of 'em!! My favourite character is Phoebe!! I love you Lisa Kudrowüíïüíï
Ubaludo Mgulunde,5.0,"I have never got tired of repeating this show, I keep on repeating it over and over and it really never gets old. Why cant you just produce another show like the way sex and the city cast is doing? 
believe me you will become extra extra rich because I can not wait to see how Emma (Ross and Rachel kid )  has grown, how Joey life is going on, how Chandler and Ross are doing, how Phoebe and Mike are doing, how Gunther is doing, and to hear that Janice's laugh ha-ha please consider"
Sunny Daniel,5.0,Started watching just to pass time but soon became addicted to it. It was such fun to watch each episode. The last episode made my eyes wet. Hope such show could have lasted this day. A Brilliant show.!
Producer Gedalia,5.0,"No TV Show can compare to Friends.  Not even Modern Family will ever stand to the same category.  The actors, screenwriters, producers and all post production staff are what made Friends so iconic.  I am a super fan!"
Azka Fazal_10,5.0,If you like comedy and not dark comedy (which is super rare in this generation) you'll love this show! It's the best comedy show ever!!!!!! I just love it!!!

Techno Dream,5.0,"It's one of the most beautiful and emotional series I have ever watched. Like the plot, the story, the characters, all are awesome. I wish that I could meet the cast. The one man who always made us laugh is now goneüòì. I miss you Chandler. I wish the series should have never ended. Sometimes, I remember the scenes and think that what if the series still on...."

Wikki Foo,4.0,"Sienfeld is the greatest sitcom ever and after that I would rate friends . 
Friends was really good specially Chandler , joie and very beautiful Monika these 3 characters are gems.

Tenzin Thutop,5.0,"Hi there 
I might be little late but I found some wrong or mistake in FRIENDS season 3 episode 1. When Ross was talking to Rachel. Ross took a chocolate bar from the fridge and took a bite out of it. And in the next part ( when there was change in the point of view ) the chocolate bar in hand of Ross was fresh not a bite. The timing was about 11:30 and the next 15 sec. You'll see. 
You guys should check it out. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£"
Gaurav Anand,5.0,"Thanks to lockdown. I watched all episodes of all season...
Nice work done by writers and all the actors played character so so well ..after watching all episodes you will also start imagining yourself into one of the character.
Monica Geller(Courteney Cox) is my favorite character in the series."
Sakib Shahriar,0.0,"There's no other show I felt so emotionally connected with. There can not be a better show ever in the world & I believe that from the deepest bottom of my heart. I just finished it and now I am really really sad. I love you Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Joey, Pheobe & Ross. I just love you guys. I'll miss you. Actually, I already am. I'm sure you guys are spending your days with much more fun and love. It's just I can't see you anymore.

Stay like this, always. LOVE YOU TILL ETERNITY....."
Summer Durrant,0.0,I love this show. In my opinion I think it is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched and it has helped me through so many difficulties during my life. Although I am only 10 I defiantly think it is one of the best anybody could ever watch
PALLAB BARMAN,5.0,"""Friends"" is the show that took Television by storm. This is a milestone that is untouched even after decades. Before watching the show I didn't understand what was all the fuss about but now I do understand. It's contagious. There is a lot of loop holes of course. Maybe the makers didn't understand that the show will be Sush a big hit. But the characters compensate for all that. Though I don't understand why they forgot about Ben."
Ava Kara,5.0,This show is more than great!!! It is funny and such an ease to watch. I have been watching Friends for my whole life and I watch it every day and never get bored. Amazing show definitely recommend watching!!

Sikandar Ijaz,5.0,The best comedy season ever. I started watching season to past time and then become so addictive that i ended up finishing whole series in just one month. I loved every character especially joey.
