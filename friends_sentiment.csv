they disrespect indian tradition in s8 e8 1043

the storyline was really good when it started 6 friends living together  support each other in needy situations to get out of trouble

the show should have ended for 6 seasons then it gets really weird i would say that show should have either ended within 56 season or the writers should have innovated instead the production house decided to earn more money  then the writers could not bring up with new content so they have decided to introduce more  more characters into the main cast lives so that there will be more confusion  less laughter

i am not sure if the director has actually read the script  realize where the show was going

at one point i couldnt watch the show anymore  had to skip the complete episodes

ʚ flurrelia ɞ “Maya”,3.0,"theres been a fair bit of controversy over bill condons liveaction remake of disneys animated 1991 classic beauty and the beast mostly centered over condons proclamation that hes given disney its first canonically openly gay character in an interview with attitude condon described that character the villains sycophantic sidekick lefou as if his sexuality was a significant foregrounded part of the plot and as if it ultimately arrived at some major moment of truth

hes confused about what he wants its somebody whos just realising that he has these feelings and actor josh gad makes something really subtle and delicious out of it and thats what has its payoff at the end which i dont want to give away but it is a nice exclusively gay moment in a disney movie

Kyle Ellis,5.0,"i have nothing against sitcoms in general as long as they are funny in america there is frasier and will  grace in britain there is only fools and horses and last of the summer wine they are great sitcoms there was a time when i didnt like friends very much then again it was also at a time when i wasnt into sitcoms my brother and sister who absolutely adore the show suggested i should try the show again so i did well my initial reaction of the show was wrong this show is great it is funny and smart with appealing characters it is by far one of the better american sitcoms and i do think it is better than everybody loves raymond

first and foremost i love the theme song it may get on some peoples nerves but i find it irresistibly catchy memorable and fun with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant

i also love how funny and smart friends is some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever that reminds me when i see and review when harry met sally maybe the title of the review should be the one with the scene in the diner along with this the writing is consistently funny with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy i even like the plot lines i dont find them boring predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile

the direction is also really solid and the photography and scenery are striking

i love the characters they are unique and engaging even with their flaws they manage to be likable rachel does have moments when she is spoilt but she is also the epitome of sweetness i know there are people who have problems with jennifer aniston the thing is i dont and i find her at her prettiest and most appealing here monica is another strong character not the funniest by all means but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude i loved how courtney cox portrayed her phoebe is my favourite female character she is hilarious i especially love her songs they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great lisa kudrow couldnt have been the more perfect choice for her she pulls off phoebes personality to perfection

joey is stupid admittedly but i love him anyway because he is also cool i am not a huge fan of matt leblanc but he is really good as joey matthew perry is great as chandler who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character who makes jokes that are almost as bad as phoebes songs but he is still a likable character in his own right ross is deliciously neurotic i constantly love his priceless facial expressions and david schwimmers delivery is absolutely perfect

there have also been some wonderful guest stars elliot gould as jack geller gary oldmanwho i really like in films like dracula and immortal beloved as richard crosby michael mckean and danny devito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policemans outfit all but to name a few overall i love this show not only for the writing but for the characters 1010 bethany cox",i have nothing against sitcoms

Wraith Watchful,5.0,"i only watched this show in my later years whenever they put it on netflix i thought that the show was absolutely wonderful 

my experience before with david arquette and courtney cox was along the lines of buffy the vampire slayer  scream seeing them in this show was really cool  refreshing lisa kudrows type of humor was something that had to grow on me because i didnt like her character at first i do now  david schwimmer was pretty cute on the show and pulled off an intense and sort of nerdy phd that worked in a museum with dinosaurs jennifer aniston always seemed to be showing her highbeams through every single shirt that she wore on every single episode that she was in her acting is excellent however and in my opinion didnt need to be so obviously oversexed 

chandler was probably my favorite because he was so awkward but extremely funny  i loved the depth of his character  also whenever he and monica finally got together

initially chandlers character looked the most comical during the first two seasons but after that joeys character stood out to best in the series throwing up with instantaneous jokes that would tickle most of the bones in our body

the scene where joey is asked to describe the relationship between monica and chandler and add something about love he consciously uses alliteration with lovingsharinggivingtaking even after he inadvertently uses a better description of how they meant to him that is the best scene of the series

Fiona Baker,5.0,"one of the best and most heartwarming sitcoms ever i watched this because of an edit i saw and i never regretted it after

this show is handsdown one of the best sitcoms ever i have watched many sitcoms before like big bang but this one truely changed my vision on love friendship and life

for one the show is way ahead of its time showing family issues pregnancy situations and issues lgbtq being open with loved ones mental disorders different religions and so much more it really shows how different life is to everybody

i also loved it because friends actually knows when to put laughing tracks in the past i have watched some sitcoms like big bang where they will be in a serious situation and somehow always make a joke out of it friends doesnt do that they have many serious situations heartwarming heartbreaking etc now sometimes they add jokes in serious situations but they actually know when its okay to add jokes to situations like that which i think is really important for a sitcom

also it really showcases how much you can love people blood family or not and how you can choose your own family even if they are related to you or not the 6 main characters love each other like family but only monika and ross are related

i didnt like how quirky they made monikas ocd but i do understand why they did if they made it as serious as it is irl it wouldve been a way darker show

i also love the romances in the show it really captivates how you can love many people at the same time or be stuck on someone you still love etc

i just had to make one more paragraph for matthew perry rip matt you were a legendary actor and you will never be forgotten

Steven Solomon,5.0,"i loved them for now and for 10 years when i was lonely they were my friendsi feel like i know every one of them as characters and the actors themselves my crush on jennifer aniston along with my disgust with brad for their breakup and my strange marvel at david schwimmers athleticism as in the multihour catch sequence with joey and later monica and his impromptu juggling were all outstanding he was definitely my hero in the show and of course i berated him for all the errors he committed during his courtship of rachel yes i am one of those incurable romantics that pledged if ross wouldnt take her i would certainly make myself available but as awkward as it seemed i was always rooting for them 

schwimmer also was impressive as robert kardashian in the people v o j simpson replete with white hair tufts he is an exceptional actor

Jules Sherwood,5.0,"grew up watching friends when it first aired in the 90s and the show created lightning in a bottle with each actor they cast for their iconic roles of course everyone knows who jennifer aniston is now but back then she was not massively known and this like her costars was her breakthrough role and anywhere they went in the world people in the street would shout their characters name

lisa kudrow was known to some as ursula on mad about you and thanks to the bosses there allowed to her be on both shows playing twin sisters in a double episode of the 1st season where in we get guest appearances not only from helen hunt but george clooney and  the actor who was dr carter whilst they were filming er

we all loved the rossrachel drama along with monica finding love with chandler phoebe getting her man and joey being joey  

the show attracted alot of famous faces including julia roberts danny devito tate donovan bruce willis dan castellena aka homer hank azaria paul rudd reese witherspoon christina applegate tom selleck brad pitt freddie prinze jr and many more also for those of you who never watched the show we got appearances from tom conti jennifer saunders june whitfield helen baxendale richard branson and the duchess of york when they came over to england to film the wedding of ross and emily where ross says the wrong name shows how popular it was all around the world in the early days this was before twitter

charlie sheen makes a guest star appearance before his long run in comedy two and a half men jennifer grey shows up as ex friend of rachels mindy who marries barry the man she left at the altar in the 1st episode  for those stargate fans we get peter deluise showing his acting skills before he was more known as a director for stargate sg1

of course we cant leave out the one and only janice played by maggie wheeler who was a staple for chandlers hysterics anytime she came in and uttered that immortal line oh my god before that freaky laugh she did what an asset she was to the show alongside elliot gould and christine pickles who played the parents of ross and monica geller

this show proves with great writing and acting how something so beloved has lasted for 25 years we all have our favourite episodes and for each generation that has come since have found things that are relatable not many shows or sitcoms have that power

how i met your mother
character development barneys was squandered lily was the same person ted got way worst marshal got boring and robin was fine

friends
character development chandler grew so much rachel is unrecognisable in the last season in a good way phoebe finally finds what she wants joey matures monica becomes a mother and ross finally finds the life hes always wanted

how i met your mother
how its aged every joke is about sluts girls sex porn and homophobia its also racist look at this quote theres only one reason to wait for sex and thats if the girl is 17 like are you kidding me

how its aged while it was a white cast and there are some toxic masculinity and fat shaming jokes its aged better then himym by a long shot and they didnt know the stuff at the time himym was made less then ten years ago

how i met your mother
did it overstay the 9 seasons season 67 8 and maybe 9 couldve been cut down to 2 or 3 seasons

friends
did it overstay the 10 seasons while season 9 shouldve been the last one every season still has a natural ark and is solid

how i met your mother
romance and comedy as i said before its the worst type of comedy while marshal and lily are cute they are sometimes very problematic robin and barney shouldve been endgame and dont get me started on ted and robin 

friends 
romance and comedy not one episode doesnt have a witty joke or hilarious one the comedy has aged surprisingly well and monica and chandler are just hands down the best tv couple phoebe and mike are great and ross and rachel while sometimes off are each others lobsters

all the characters were very flirty and always ready to get to bed with anyone but the monica rachel phoebies bed and kiss scenes were shown much much more than the ross chandler and joeys

what i saw that this show objectified women a lot that was so sad to watch sometimes 

other thing was no one was serious on anything its all funny from day to night everyone is acting hard to be sarcastic funny 

they are trying very very damn hard to be mature understand relationships etc etc etc but all they do is goof around with strangers all the time so basically there is nothing to learn from the show except be funny and be with friends 

what i loved most about this show was that there is always a vibe of positivity and happiness flowing around in the show and that itself is a award winning show

the best thing about this show is no matter how many times you watch it you will laugh as hard as you did the first time people think that it is overrated but the thing is that they havent watched it and just cant stand its popularity this show made me laugh cry and fall in love with its characters

ross ross is a divorced guy whose ex wife is a lesbian i think he is the most underrated character because his acting is so great his relationship with joey phoebe and the other three is really great he works in a museum and he loves dinosaurs

chandler the king of sarcasm   chandler is a normal working guy with joey as his roommate his comic timing and sense of humour is so awesome his relationship with joey is also great 

monica she is rosss sister she is always very organised and clean and she is beautiful 

phoebe  my fav character and weirdest in the gang she is a vegan and also believes in some superstitious stuffs i love her relationship with joey their conversations are always so weird her back story is also so weird and when she is losing an arguement she uses her mothers suicide as a sheild she has a twin sister ursula and they two hate each other phoebe believes her grandfather is albert einstein as it is told by her grandmother 

joey foody childish dumb are the words to describe joey tribbiani his relationship with his friends is so great he loves them immensely and to him his friends are his world he is a struggling actor and dates many girls

rachel when the show starts she is potrayed as a spoiled daughter of a rich man but as the show progresses she starts realising the importance of self reliance she is beautiful sexy and her relationship with her friends is great
