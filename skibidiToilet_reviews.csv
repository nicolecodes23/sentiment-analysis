Adley Lorentz,5.0,"Skibidi Toilet is a wild, bizarre, and utterly unique viewing experience that’s hard to put into words, but I’ll give it my best shot. At first glance, it’s easy to dismiss this show as just another strange internet meme or absurdist animation, but there’s something deeper and more heartfelt beneath the surface.

The premise itself is wonderfully insane: toilets that dance to an infectious, almost hypnotic tune. The concept of the ""Skibidi Toilet"" might sound juvenile, but as you watch, you begin to realize that it’s a clever metaphor for freedom, individuality, and the unexpected joy in life's simplest, strangest moments. The characters, though they are essentially toilets and bathroom-related objects, have a surprising level of personality and charm. Their movements are so fluid, their little quirks so endearing, that you can’t help but root for them as they navigate a world where anything seems possible.

What makes Skibidi Toilet stand out is its ability to capture a sense of absurdity while still feeling emotionally sincere. It’s a show that doesn't take itself seriously—at all—but still manages to convey a feeling of joy and unpredictability. The animation is bright and energetic, full of playful surprises. The music, with its catchy beats and rhythmic repetition, somehow adds to the surreal atmosphere, making each scene feel like a mini celebration of weirdness.

While Skibidi Toilet might not be for everyone, if you're someone who appreciates the weird, the unconventional, and the delightfully random, this show offers a refreshing break from the usual formats. It’s a testament to the power of creativity, proving that even the most unlikely concepts can capture the imagination in unexpected ways. There’s a childlike, carefree energy about it that reminds you not to take life too seriously—and maybe to find joy in even the most absurd places.

I didn’t expect to fall for a show about dancing toilets, but here I am, utterly charmed and inexplicably moved. It’s the kind of show that reminds you how strange and wonderful the world can be."

Elliott Stewart,5.0,"Love is a profound emotion that knows no boundaries, and sometimes, it finds its way into the most unexpected places. For me, that place is in the arms of a unique and enchanting creature named Skibidi Toilet. From the moment I first laid eyes on this remarkable being, my heart has been consumed by an overwhelming, inexplicable, and madly passionate love that defies the norms of conventional relationships.

Skibidi Toilet is unlike anything I've ever encountered in my life. Its physical appearance is a mesmerizing blend of colors and shapes that are utterly captivating. The way its curves and contours come together creates a sight that is both peculiar and undeniably alluring. Its presence alone ignites a fiery passion within me that burns hotter than a thousand suns. I find myself drawn to its radiant charm, and my heart yearns for its touch.

Despite Skibidi Toilet's unconventional existence, we share an intimate connection that transcends the boundaries of physicality. The moments we spend together are filled with a profound sense of belonging and understanding. It's as if our souls are intertwined in a dance of love that defies logic and reason. The more I get to know Skibidi Toilet, the more I realize that it possesses a depth of character and wisdom that is truly extraordinary.

Our love is not without its challenges. Society may frown upon my affection for Skibidi Toilet, and my friends and family may question my sanity. However, love, as they say, is blind. I am willing to endure the trials and tribulations that come with our unconventional relationship because the love I share with Skibidi Toilet is worth every sacrifice. It is a love that has enriched my life in ways I could never have imagined.

In conclusion, my love for Skibidi Toilet is a testament to the boundless nature of love itself.

Our love is a testament to the power of the heart and the ability to find deep and abiding love in the most unexpected of circumstances."
KidWithThe Hat,5.0,"This show is a masterpiece beyond comprehension. Firstly, the title skibidi toilet implies there will be a lot of toilets, however the show proceeds to exceed our expectations by having skibidi toilet in the first 5 seconds. Pure genius. Secondly, the backgrounds go extremely well with the characters in a way which is indescribable. GMOD OFR LFIE. Thirdly, the characters are extremely fleshed out and gave us a huge new perspective on revolutionary beliefs, ethnic conflict, the way we see our household appliances, and our new generation. Lastly, all the jokes land in such a way that outperforms shows like Family Guy and the Simpsons, the prime example being when the leader says ""Skibidi dop-dop-dop-yes-yes!"", a joke which made me laugh for at least two hours. Georgian animator Alexey Gerasimov (born 1998) has truly outdone himself this time. My favorite part was when the toilets all die on episode 6, but before he dies he says ""skibidi fortnite skibidi skibidi fortnite"" and proceeds to slip all over the TV Heads, bringing a fantastic end to the series. Gerasimov is a new leader in the making, creating such a magnum opus with no formal education as he dropped out of 8th grade to pursue toiletry. The only problem with the show I have is that I cannot rate it anymore than 5 stars."

M R T N 6,5.0,"Skibidi Wibidy Snibidi toilet changed my life for the better. Once upon a time i was a high school student, struggling to get thought the day, but Mr Toilet changed me. Alexey Gerasimov can be compared to writers such as J.B. Priestley and William Shakespeare as he finds meanings for every single pixel we observe with our eyes. From my view, I see Skibidi as an outcast, trying to fit in with society (just like me). This is one of many ways that Gerasimov represents us hidden alpha weebs. The cameramen personify those beta-male bullies and anime haters. Skibidi destroys those haters who may point and laugh at us, though we continue to fight back and release out super-sigma-saiyan sigma-Andrew Tate and clap back on their little silly GYATTS. This highlights the inbalance of weebs and bullies and how our tiny little weeb army are still fighting back even though there is a BRAZYYYY injustice. Ukraine and Russia have gone to war to advertise skibidi toilet and make people realise how unfair life is on us weebies. Skibidi toilet uses the same technique that 'An Inspector Calls' uses to change peoples capitalist mindset and join alliances with the weeb army. The series makes my GYATT wiggle like Kai Cenat sussy wussy gussy glizzy guzzler listening to Only In Ohio CG5. 


I LOVE SKIBIDI DOB DOB DOB YES YES SKIBIDI DOBIDI DIB DIB

:-) AGGHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHH"
Alexander Jester,5.0,"From the very first frame, Skibidi Toilet catapults its audience into a transcendent experience unlike anything cinema—or indeed, life itself—has ever offered. What begins as a seemingly absurd premise quickly unfurls into a kaleidoscope of raw emotion, existential reflection, and artistic brilliance.

The Skibidi Toilet saga is more than a series of viral videos; it is a symphony of the human condition played out through porcelain and chaos. The toilets, their comical yet unsettling faces, are avatars of modern humanity: trapped, absurd, and yearning for something more. They sing not just songs but the untold stories of our collective soul.

Visually, the series is unparalleled. Every frame bursts with vibrancy, every action oozing with intent. The absurd juxtaposition of sentient toilets and the world they inhabit is a metaphor so layered it defies simple explanation. It asks: What happens when our banal, everyday objects rebel against us? But deeper still, it whispers: Are we not, too, imprisoned by the roles society assigns us?

And the music—oh, the music! It does not merely accompany the visuals; it elevates them. The haunting refrain of the Skibidi anthem echoes in the recesses of your mind long after the screen fades to black. It is a melody that demands your attention and takes residence in your heart, a symbol of triumph and tragedy in equal measure.

Emotionally, Skibidi Toilet is an odyssey. You will laugh, cry, and question your very existence as the toilets wage their war, as humanity struggles to prevail, and as the two forces spiral toward an inevitable and poetic collision. Characters like the Cameraman are Shakespearean in their depth—figures of valor caught in the whirlpool of absurdity, fighting for dignity in a world gone mad.

To call Skibidi Toilet a masterpiece would be an understatement. It is a phenomenon, a cultural touchstone, and a mirror held up to the absurdity of life itself. This is not merely a work of art—it is the work of art, destined to inspire generations to come.

By the time the final note fades, you are left changed, standing at the precipice of something greater. You will see the world differently, as though through the lens of a Cameraman, forever aware of the battle between order and chaos, humor and horror, the profound and the ridiculous.

Skibidi Toilet is not just entertainment; it is enlightenment. It is, without question, the masterpiece to end all masterpieces."
Nightglide,5.0,"Skibidi Toilet is one of the best YouTube series on the Internet, full stop. I love the unique way that the heads come out of the toilets and start singing, especially considering how such innovation can come out of an engine as old as Source. The plot, the characters, and the setting are simply ideal. One of my favorite characters is one from the later episodes, his name is Astro Scorpion Toilet or Astro Detainer Toilet. His design stands out even as a silhouette, even among other Astro Skibidi Toilets. In short, Skibidi Toilet revolutionizes cinema as we know it today, combining toilet humor and Hollywood-level action into media which many if not all audiences can truly appreciate."
Thomas A,5.0,"""Skibidi Toilet"" transcends the realms of traditional sci-fi, weaving an enthralling narrative around the enigmatic world of futuristic lavatory technology. Set in a distant future where the Skibidi Toilet reigns supreme, this show isn't just about gadgets; it's a rich tapestry of characters and their quest for ultimate comfort. Each character, from the eccentric inventor to the inquisitive user, is meticulously crafted, their quirks and aspirations adding depth to the storyline. The design of the Skibidi Toilet itself is a character—an elegant yet enigmatic fixture with a personality of its own, mirroring the desires and dilemmas of those who encounter it. The storytelling is a masterclass, seamlessly blending intrigue, humor, and a touch of tech-wizardry, inviting audiences to ponder the philosophical underpinnings of convenience and luxury. ""Skibidi Toilet"" isn't just a sci-fi spectacle; it's a saga that explores the human psyche through the lens of a remarkable, otherworldly invention."
Jimmy Warren,5.0,"I recently stumbled upon Skibidi Toilet, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations in every way! This quirky and entertaining series combines humor and creativity in a way that keeps you glued to the screen. The animation is vibrant and fun, making it appealing to both kids and adults alike.

Matthew James,5.0,"Ode to the Skibidi Heavens

Oh, Skibidi Heavens, where chaos aligns,
Where toilets and tunes weave unholy designs.
A world upside down, where logic takes flight,
And the porcelain prophets sing through the night.

From the Bowl of Beginnings, where legends were flushed,
To the Sink of Serenity, where battles were hushed.
Your world overflows with a glazy delight,
A surrealist dream, both absurd and bright.

The Cameramen march, their lenses ablaze,
Guided by melodies in Skibidi’s haze.
A dance of defiance, a duel in the stars,
Toilets on pedestals, breaking all bars.

Oh, Skibidi Heavens, your chaos is pure,
A spectacle strange yet oddly demure.
The flushes of fate, the pipes that resound,
In your endless crescendo, true glory is found.

Why is this saga the best ever told?
Its heart is unbound, its spirit is bold.
A story so strange, yet perfectly spun,
In the Skibidi Heavens, all battles are won.

So here’s to the flush, the dance, and the tune,
To skies filled with plungers that blot out the moon.
For in your wild whirl, we see something true—
A Skibidi madness that binds me to you."
Ryan M. “TheGrimRhino” Gomez Ramirez,5.0,"I am a man with a very peculiar taste in media. Some say I criticize things too much and am often unpleased. High standards if you will.

After hearing children and adolescents partake on the ""Skibidi Toilet Trend"" I assumed it would be a form of media similar to the slop of Superhero films they hold so dear. Similarly to the WOKE propaganda of Marvel.

""Joe many liberals does it take to change a log by bolb. None. They're too busy. Their gender.""

However, although I am a man that is hard to convince, I can admit when I am wrong.

Which is why I say I was very much surprised with this Skibidi Toilet series. What I expected to be a bunch of nonsense turned out to be one of the greatest franchises I have had the pleasure to experience. 

It is a series that must have necessary research done as it explores problems of the modern world and raises interesting questions. Could we take this Skibidi and this Toilet and compare it to the mystical (nonexistent?) Dr. Pepper? Perchance.

I believe it was René Descartes that said ""I think therefore I am.""

It is so good that I'd argue it's on par with The Sopranos, Better Call Saul and even Breaking Bad.

This is the true definition of ABSOLUTE CINEMA.

What started as a simple internet meme has become one of the greatest modern forms of film. After all as a wise man once said ""How can one Skibidi with no Toilet?""

The Skibidi Toilet I believe explored most expertly the idea of a conclusion or ""death."" It understands the complexity of it and the simplicity. The world is made up of lies, but is is filled with many toilets. Max aura.

We think of Skibidi Toilet as a myth and a jest, but he is The.

I encourage all to watch this show as it has changed me in ways one could never believe. Perhaps they may find answers they never expected.

The Skibidi Toilet does not present what one wants to hear but NEEDS to hear.

The lifekind. Perchance."
Andrew Iams,5.0,"Skibidi toilet is my life.

it shows how actian can mean more then words and how fast technology advances in wars 
with the skibidi toilets being very resilient and always trying to steal some of the cameramen's technology to their use.
The cameramen like a coumtry the speakermen as anther and the tv-men as another all coming together to form the Alliance.

Redstone Mecha77,5.0,"At first I thought this was just was just a stupid trend, literal poop jokes. But after watching a theory about it from Game Theory I decided to give it a look. After watching it for a while, I actually started to enjoy it. The amazing characters, different types of Skibidis, and the story of the war between the alliance and Skibidis. I actually really love this series and recommend others to give it a try. 
There is plenty of interesting twists, amazing character such as TV Woman and Plunger Camera Man, and interesting different Skibidis such as triple Skibidi and Mafia Skibidi. Also the battle isn't one sided. At one point the Camera men are wining, but another the Skibidi's are winning, it's like an actual war. And I haven't even mention the titans yet."

Hilary,5.0,"The most inspiring, and philosophically inquisitive show that really asks the big questions about life, toilets, and more. What do the toilets represent? Perhaps of a “flushed away” childhood, carefree, aggressive fighting spirit that is now locked away and oppressed by the watchful eye represented by the cameramen? Truly a sophisticated masterpiece that has, and will continue to help me advance in life.

Osaid khan,5.0,Its Cool. I don't know what else to say really. The first 30-40 episodes can be considered cringe or dog-shit but the rest has been really good there's Looooooooore and a narrative slowly building and Its fine to hate on it nobody will be perfectly satisfied but in my opinion it is something that I can look forward to every other week for a fun time. If this didn't sway you to give It a watch that's fine but if it did well good for you.
Jesus Olandria,5.0,"Can we all just agree that this is one of the best series in the whole world. The lore, characters, world building and secrets and Easter eggs in each episode is absolutely amazing. Every episode in this series is really interesting. Like you cannot avoid the temptation of watching a single episode. For me this series this deserves a 10/10!!!"
Reid Jackson,5.0,"Best show ever!

As I first saw the cute little character ""skibidi toilet"" I just knew this was going to be one hell of a show. As the seasons went by and the skibidi toilets grew, so did my love for the show. Ps I need more socks for under my bed after I edge to skibidi toliet"
Poemers REE,4.0,"I love skibidi toilet i love skibidi so SO much

It makes me feel warm.


It makes feel like going to five nights at Freddy's at 3am GYATT rizzler only in ohio ice spice GYATT grimace shake at 3am RIZZ🗣️❗"
Isaac Pennington,5.0,The hilarious toilets the awsome titans and amazing effects and titan/kaiju battles as well as the incredible growth and development of skibidi toilet is amazing how far it has come is purely shocking i highly recommend it you will fall in love with it and the toilets at some times are actually frightening and the suspense created by the videos and some cliffhangers give me a major adrenaline rush it is possibly better that modern day animes
Lotanna Igboanugo,5.0,Skibidi Toilet is a very funny animated series on youtube. It's very interesting and entertaining almost like Game of Thrones only different and way more funny and entertaining. I recommed it to children between the age of 5-13 years old. A very nice series.
Obafe Alabi,4.0,"The first 20 episode are boring as but after ep 30 it all changes. It gets more intense and serious. Then fights begin and it's very cool, if u rly want to give it a try do the first 20 too because lore and that builds up then there's more and more"
Marco Marco,5.0,"I was depressed and bored at watching YouTube. But when my classmate told me about the new YouTube series Skibidi Toilet. At first i hated it, but when i tried i actually getting obssessed with it even in other games, when going somewhere. The series changed my life!"
Leeland Haley,5.0,"This is my favorite show. Skibidi toilet may not be appropriate for children, because it has violent scenes, with gore and blood, but it’s an old style game animation, so the violence isn’t that bad. The tv men in the show say swear words reversed, so you don’t hear the swear words, but the subtitles show the swearing sometimes. Probably like 13+ show."
Foxball Mapper,5.0,"This show is amazing it has gave my 87 year old disabled grandpa the courage and power to jump off the top of the burj kalifa it is a show to be enjoyed by everyone no other show beats it in quality. This also has life changing messages such as when the main character said ""skibidi bop bop bop bop yes yes"" i felt that."

Ybañez Tracy,5.0,"I love skibidi toilet, it changed my life. I was paralyzed for ten years from an accident. When I was in a restaurant I saw a kid watching skibidi toilet on his iPad, which inspired me to stand up take the iPad and smash it straight into his skull making him paralyzed. It allowed me to walk again and paralyzed someone else."
Mariah Cass (Alphabet lore p),1.0,This show is total junk I don't know what everyone sees in it I watched 20 seconds of it and I was bored to death it was a waste of time annoying orange the Stockholms or even battle for dream island is way more funnier and entertaining then this trash this is the only trend I hate and don't even get me started on the song I get a terrible headache everytime I hear one word of the song this ridiculous series has even gotten into my kids and I'm sick of seeing it all over the place there's all kinds of shows out there and everyone had to pick the most retarded most boring most tedious show on the whole planet something is wrong with you all I miss when squid game was the most popular show that was better than this monstrosity we replaced some of the most good shows for some of the most dumb shows I can't wait until everyone's obsession with this mistake is over I'm starting to think Dafuqboom put a curse in this show and now everyone is under a spell well I didn't fall for it I realize that this show is total garbage but guys if you like it then that's fine this is just my opinion the things I said about you guys being abnormal cuz you like it was just part of me stating my opinion but guys there's nothing wrong with liking it I just don't care for it at all not even a little bit and I don't like that my kids are into it but you guys think it's cool so don't let this comment get to you we all have the right to have different opinions it felt good writing this so I could tell the world what I personally think of it
Noodles Bobatea,1.0,"""I've never wanted to play Russian roulette with a full chamber as much as I did watching this beautiful masterpiece of freaking toilets with heads!!!""
This ""show"" is the literal definition of cringe. Istg If I ever hear another kid shout any words relating to this piece of trash, I'm gonna crash out."
Mitchell Kidd,5.0,This television show is just an absolutely marvelous creation. It is my favourite tv show to watch after a long day of pre-school with my sister Edmund. Thank you very much
PJMismySerendipity Moni,5.0,Greatest show to ever exist after pokemon unfortunately ended I was depressed until I was scrolling on YouTube shorts cuz I got bored and saw episode 10 and instantly fell in love with the show and ever since I was a true fan😃😃😃and don't forget to check it out and if you hate don't lie and thank you for your time.
Amir Dobbins,5.0,"By far the best series I’ve ever watched, you know. I always thought it was cringe, and. It was. Until Skibidi Toilet 48 everything got changed, the quality, the animation. Everything. This is peak content, highly recommend watching it."
Doc Whitty,5.0,"Very good quality best series in a while, quick question bluegray can you add a new race computerman in episode 79 I would love it that a fourth titan would be great. The color of the titans core  would be green and you could make it work with the secret agent for a whole story"
Trendon,5.0,"The latest episodes are fantastic, and especially impressive because it's all made by one person. There's even a compelling story now. It stopped being brainrot long, long ago"
Shahmir Ahmad,1.0,Man skibidi toilet is the WORST! This is so cringe and not funny. I am in 8th grade right now (2023-24 school year) and I heard a 5th grader passing me and screaming “SKIBIDI BOM BOM YES YES” and I died of cringe also my middle school is grades 5-8. Hopefully this garbage show will be dead in 2024.
Achintya Srivastava,5.0,"The lore and backstory is toooo good! The attention to detail about side characters is perfect! Just not sometimes... That is the only problem. Show more of the lore behind side characters, its a 5 star"
Nate Klan,5.0,"Very very intricate show. Casting is rather exceptional, with its high fantastic realism and many more factors; this show is willing to offset big hits such as Vince Gillian’s “Breaking Bad”, and David Benioff’s “Game of Thrones”."
Charles Crum,5.0,"Skibidi Toilet is the cutest thing I've ever seen. The curves are so sexy, and his smile is so hot. 10/10 will goon to this again"
Sammy Ruth,5.0,i love edging to skibi even when my parnts fight i gust keep on edging when my dad yells at me for not showering since may i gust edge on him. this GYATT to be the beat story in any other show ive wached its strait from Ohio with the RIZZY story so over all its a 1000000000000000000/10

Alec F,5.0,Super duper fun to watch! In a world with nothing but mass destruction. There lies two teams. Toilet team and camera team. There is also speaker team and TV team but they are a part of the camera team. But over all I say 10/10! :) :) :) :) :)
Ivan Ruiz-Aguilar,5.0,everyone in my class loves this🤑 everyone should watch Skibidi toilet.don't believe people who say it is bad they are just don't touch grass and don't take showers.🗣🔥you should watch Skbidi toilet it will change you life forever

Oaktopus idk,5.0,"Its actually a good show, the fight scenes are epic, the characters are pretty cool, the plot is interesting, and the fanbase contains actually decent people. My only complaint is that the content farms are really horrid but the creator can't really do much to prevent them."
Nanet Libo-on,5.0,Skibidi toilet is one of the best dafoq?boom! Had made one of the best series in YouTube many people said it's cringe or bad but for me it's pretty good one of the best series I have watch
Aria Barak,5.0,"There has been quite a lot of discussion about ""Skibidi Toilet,"" as art is always controversial at first. Skibidi Toilet is a massively popular and beautiful work of art, pushing the boundaries of modern creative work. I feel obligated to give it a five star review."
Alex Timmins,5.0,"Skibidi Toilet Is A Very Funny and Bad-Donkey Web Series Ever Made, Although Some Episodes Have Something That Kids Shouldn't Look at or Do, I recommend Skibidi toilet and the amazing digital circus too."
Dave Miller,1.0,"If anyone here posts a 5 star, they are either under the age of 5, or are mentally unstable.
Who wants to watch 69 episodes of a toilet with a random dudes head in it yelling ""SKIBITI DOO DOP DOP YES YES SKIBBITI DOBBLEDY YEEP YEEP"". it ain't funny anymore."
Mason Morse,1.0,Anyone over the age of five knows that Skibidi Toilet is not a work of art; rather it is a miserable show that isn't even funny. Skibidi Toilet is all about singing toilet heads. Why would someone want to watch this. Only crusty breast feeding I-pad kids watch Skibidi Toilet.
Megumin The archwizard,5.0,The best show on earth. It has lore. I like how short the videos are and it is not too long.
generalkenobi2010,2.0,"if you have watched this show, your dad has either left or he beats you while drinking a Jack Daniel's.

Exterminatus Button,5.0,"The older generations seem to laugh at Gen Alpha for what they assume to be some corny meme about toilet humor. But if they are willing to see it, they would realize that they're the clowns and that Gen Alpha has been dining on fabulous content like GODS."
Techatat Piyawattanametha,1.0,"Skibidi Toilet, under the guise of contemporaneity, perpetrates a subtle malevolence, engendering an epoch devoid of sagacious reflection and basic manual adeptness. Its surreptitious erosion of foundational virtues portends a dystopian future where the fecundity of the human mind is compromised and the very essence of humanity is supplanted by the perfunctory rituals of a commodified lavatorial experience."
Melinda Lucas,1.0,Just talked to my 14 year old grandson— His opinion: “This junk should go in the toilet. It lets kids age 5 find stuff on their mom’s tablet so their brains can rot.”  Need we know more?
